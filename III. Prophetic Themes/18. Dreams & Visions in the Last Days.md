**Dreams & Visions in the Last Days** – Acts 2:17 is about **a maturing Bride, not destruction**
_(Transitioning from Fear-Based End-Times Thinking to a Christ-Centered Prophetic Awakening)_

#### **Introduction: A Generation Seeing in the Spirit**

Throughout history, **God has spoken through dreams and visions**.

- **Joseph** interpreted Pharaoh’s dream and saved nations.
- **Daniel** received visions of empires and the coming of Christ.
- **Peter** saw a vision that opened the Gospel to the Gentiles.
- **John** received the great Revelation of Christ’s victory.

And now, in these last days, God is still **speaking to His people through dreams and visions**.

But while many **pursue supernatural experiences**, not all recognize **the true purpose of these encounters**.  
❌ Some believe every dream is a direct message from God, leading to confusion.  
❌ Some use visions to fuel fear-based eschatology instead of Kingdom hope.  
❌ Some assume dreams are only personal, missing their role in advancing Christ’s mission.

But the **true prophetic move of God** does not lead people to panic—it **leads them to Jesus**.

> _"In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams."_ (Acts 2:17)

The outpouring of the Spirit is **not about chaos**—it is about **a mature Bride who sees and speaks the heart of Christ**.

#### **Core Scripture: Numbers 12:6**

_"Listen to My words: When there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, reveal Myself to them in visions; I speak to them in dreams."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Visions Must Lead to Christ, Not Fear**

In the past, prophetic dreams often contained **warnings of judgment, destruction, or exile**.

- Noah was warned of the flood.
- Joseph interpreted Pharaoh’s famine dream.
- Daniel saw the rise and fall of empires.

But when **Jesus came**, He changed the prophetic landscape.

> _"The testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."_ (Revelation 19:10)

This means:  
✅ **Prophetic visions today must reveal Christ and His Kingdom.**  
✅ **Dreams from God will point to redemption, not just disaster.**  
✅ **End-time revelations are not about fear—they are about hope.**

Jesus Himself warned against **false prophets** who claim visions of doom but do not know His heart.

> _"Many false prophets will appear and deceive many."_ (Matthew 24:11)

A vision that does not **lead people deeper into Christ** is **not from the Spirit of Truth**.

True prophetic revelation is **not about predicting world events**—it is about **revealing the Lord of history.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Holy Spirit Speaks to All Believers**

Under the Old Covenant, only **a select few received divine dreams and visions**—prophets, kings, and priests.

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Every believer can hear God’s voice.**  
✅ **Every believer can receive Spirit-led dreams.**  
✅ **Every believer can discern divine visions.**

This is why Peter declared at Pentecost:

> _"This is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: ‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people…'"_ (Acts 2:16-17)

The Spirit is **not just speaking to church leaders**—He is **awakening the whole Body of Christ**.

This means:  
🔥 **You don’t need a prophet to interpret your dream—the Holy Spirit can reveal it to you.**  
🔥 **You don’t need a famous preacher’s vision—God can give you insight through His Word.**  
🔥 **You don’t need to fear the future—God is already reigning over it.**

> _"But when He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth… He will glorify Me because it is from Me that He will receive what He will make known to you."_ (John 16:13-14)

The goal of visions is **not to show how bad things are**—it is to **reveal how great Christ is**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Fear-Based Prophecy to Kingdom Awakening**

Many believers still interpret **dreams and visions through a lens of fear**.

- They assume every disaster dream means the world is ending.
- They interpret political turmoil as the collapse of God's plan.
- They believe every warning means imminent destruction.

But the early Church **did not fear the future—they saw it as the unfolding of Christ’s rule**.

Paul did not say, **"The last days will be terrifying."**  
He said, **"In the last days, God will pour out His Spirit!"**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From end-time panic to end-time purpose.**  
✅ **From predicting judgment to revealing Jesus.**  
✅ **From interpreting chaos to declaring the Kingdom.**

When John received **the Book of Revelation**, he was not left in fear—he was filled with **the glory of Christ**.

> _"I saw Heaven standing open… and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True."_ (Revelation 19:11)

Dreams and visions are not about **disaster**—they are about **the unfolding victory of Jesus**.

---

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Sees and Speaks as Christ’s Prophetic Bride**

The future of the Church is **not blindness—it is prophetic clarity**.

Joel saw it:

> _"I will pour out My Spirit on all people… your sons and daughters will prophesy."_ (Joel 2:28)

Daniel saw it:

> _"Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever."_ (Daniel 12:3)

John saw it:

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

This means:  
🔥 **The Church will not be confused—it will walk in clear prophetic vision.**  
🔥 **The people of God will not be deceived—they will know His voice.**  
🔥 **The Spirit is not withdrawing—He is speaking louder than ever.**

The true end-time awakening is not about **fearful Christians hiding from the world**.  
It is about **a radiant Bride, fully seeing and revealing Christ to the nations**.

The last chapter of history does not end in **darkness**—it ends with **the glory of the Lamb filling the earth**.

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

The true prophetic Church is **not running from the end**—it is **calling all people into the fullness of Christ.**

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)
