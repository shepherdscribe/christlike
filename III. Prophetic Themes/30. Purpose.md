### **The Testimony of Jesus: The Heart of Prophecy**
_(Transitioning from Self-Centered Prophecy to Christ-Centered Revelation)_

### **Introduction: What is the True Purpose of Prophecy?**

Many misunderstand prophecy in three ways:  
❌ **Some think prophecy is primarily about predicting the future.**  
❌ **Others use prophecy for personal gain or influence, treating it as spiritual currency.**  
❌ **Many fail to recognize that all true prophecy points to Christ, not just personal destiny.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **Prophecy is not about proving who is right—it is about revealing Christ.**  
🔥 **True prophetic revelation does not glorify the prophet—it magnifies Jesus.**  
🔥 **The goal of prophecy is not excitement or hype—it is transformation into Christlikeness.**

> _"For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."_ (Revelation 19:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from prophecy centered on self to prophecy that unveils Christ.**

### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 1:1-3**

_"In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom also He made the universe."_

🔥 **Jesus is not just a messenger—He is the message.**

### **The Christ Filter: How Prophecy is Fulfilled in Jesus**

Before Christ, prophecy had a **limited view**:  
🔥 **The prophets spoke of judgment, restoration, and the coming Messiah, but they did not fully grasp God’s plan.**  
🔥 **Many Israelites expected a political Messiah, missing that Christ’s Kingdom was spiritual.**  
🔥 **Prophets declared the Word, but they longed to see what we now see in Jesus.**

But when Jesus came, He **became the fulfillment of all prophetic words**:  
🔥 **He did not just speak truth—He was truth (John 14:6).**  
🔥 **He was not just another prophet—He was the Word made flesh (John 1:14).**  
🔥 **He fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, revealing God’s full plan (Matthew 5:17).**

> _"Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself."_ (Luke 24:27)

🔥 **True prophecy always leads people to a deeper revelation of Christ.**

This means:  
✅ **If a prophecy does not ultimately point to Jesus, it has missed its purpose.**  
✅ **Prophecy is not about proving who is anointed—it is about unveiling Christ.**  
✅ **All revelation must align with the nature and character of Jesus.**

> _"If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

🔥 **The Church must transition from chasing prophecies to seeking Christ-centered revelation.**

### **New Covenant Reality: Prophecy is About Revealing Christ, Not Just the Future**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Prophets spoke to kings and nations, often foretelling judgment and restoration.**
- **God’s full plan was hidden, with glimpses of the coming Messiah.**
- **People relied on prophets to hear from God because the Holy Spirit had not yet been given to all.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus is the full revelation of God (Colossians 1:19).**  
✅ **The Holy Spirit now dwells in all believers, giving direct access to revelation (Acts 2:17-18).**  
✅ **Prophecy is no longer just about foretelling events—it is about unveiling Christ’s purposes.**

Paul declared:

> _"I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better."_ (Ephesians 1:17)

🔥 **The ultimate goal of revelation is knowing Jesus more deeply.**

This means:  
✅ **Prophecy is about transformation, not just information.**  
✅ **True prophetic voices call people into Christlikeness, not just personal breakthroughs.**  
✅ **A prophecy that does not reveal Christ’s nature is incomplete.**

> _"Let the one who has My word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?" declares the Lord."_ (Jeremiah 23:28)

🔥 **The Church must transition from prophecy that entertains to prophecy that reveals Jesus.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Self-Centered Prophecy to Christ-Centered Revelation**

Many believers still **misuse or misunderstand prophecy**:  
❌ **Some use prophecy to manipulate others instead of drawing them closer to Christ.**  
❌ **Others focus only on personal gain (finances, relationships, promotion) rather than Kingdom transformation.**  
❌ **Many chase after words of knowledge but neglect intimacy with Jesus.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Prophecy was never about human ambition—it was about revealing Christ’s will.**  
🔥 **Apostolic leaders taught that prophetic words must align with God’s heart.**  
🔥 **The gifts of the Spirit function to glorify Jesus, not individuals (1 Corinthians 12:7).**

Paul wrote:

> _"Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort."_ (1 Corinthians 14:1,3)

🔥 **True prophecy strengthens, encourages, and calls people deeper into Christ’s love.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From seeking prophetic words about themselves to seeking revelation about Christ.**  
✅ **From prophecy as entertainment to prophecy as divine alignment.**  
✅ **From using prophecy for personal gain to using it for Kingdom transformation.**

> _"For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake."_ (2 Corinthians 4:5)

🔥 **If a prophecy does not reveal Jesus, it is not fully prophetic.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Prophesies the Testimony of Jesus**

The final destiny of the Church is **not just knowing prophecies but living in the full revelation of Christ.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

Jesus declared it:

> _"He will glorify Me because it is from Me that He will receive what He will make known to you."_ (John 16:14)

Paul revealed it:

> _"Until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."_ (Ephesians 4:13)

🔥 **The Church is not called to prophesy random words—it is called to prophesy Jesus!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about information—it is about transformation into Christ’s image.**  
🔥 **We are not meant to seek prophecy for ourselves—we are meant to reveal the testimony of Jesus!**

The world will not end **with a Church chasing prophecies**—  
🔥 **It will end with a Church fully manifesting the revelation of Christ!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **We are not called to pursue prophecy for entertainment—we are called to reveal the testimony of Jesus!**
