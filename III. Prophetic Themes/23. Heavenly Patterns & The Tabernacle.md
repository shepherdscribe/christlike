**Heavenly Patterns & the Tabernacle** â€“ The Old Testament was a shadow; **Christ is the substance**
_(Transitioning from Old Covenant Shadows to New Covenant Reality in Christ)_

#### **Introduction: The Blueprint of Heaven on Earth**

When God gave Moses instructions for the **Tabernacle**, He was not just creating a **place of worship**â€”He was revealing **a pattern of heavenly realities**.

> _"See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain."_ (Hebrews 8:5, quoting Exodus 25:40)

The Tabernacle was **not the ultimate dwelling place of God**â€”it was **a shadow of something greater**.

ðŸ”¥ Every element of the Tabernacle pointed **to Christ and the New Covenant.**  
ðŸ”¥ Every ritual was **a temporary signpost** leading **to the finished work of Jesus.**  
ðŸ”¥ Every sacrifice was **a prophetic picture** of **the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world.**

But many believers still **live as if they are in the Old Covenant**:

- They seek **temples**, when they themselves are **the dwelling place of God.**
- They look for **priests**, when Jesus is **the ultimate High Priest.**
- They rely on **rituals**, when Christ has already **fulfilled the law completely.**

The Church must transition **from Old Covenant shadows to New Covenant reality**.

> _"For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."_ (John 1:17)

#### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 8:5-6**

_"They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. But in fact, the ministry Jesus has received is superior to theirs, as the covenant of which He is mediator is superior to the old one, since it is founded on better promises."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Tabernacle Was a Shadowâ€”Jesus Is the Reality**

Everything in the Tabernacle pointed **forward to Christ**.

|**Tabernacle Element**|**Fulfilled in Jesus**|
|---|---|
|The **Outer Court** (place of sacrifice)|Jesus is **the Lamb slain for sin** (John 1:29)|
|The **Bronze Altar** (atonement by blood)|Jesusâ€™ **blood is the final sacrifice** (Hebrews 9:12)|
|The **Laver** (washing with water)|Jesus is the **Living Water** (John 4:14)|
|The **Lampstand** (continual light)|Jesus is the **Light of the World** (John 8:12)|
|The **Table of Showbread** (daily bread)|Jesus is the **Bread of Life** (John 6:35)|
|The **Altar of Incense** (prayers rising to God)|Jesus is our **Intercessor** (Romans 8:34)|
|The **Veil** (barrier to God's presence)|Jesusâ€™ body was **torn to give us access** (Hebrews 10:19-20)|
|The **Ark of the Covenant** (Godâ€™s presence)|Jesus is **Emmanuelâ€”God with us** (Matthew 1:23)|

ðŸ”¥ The Tabernacle was a **model**â€”Jesus is **the fulfillment**.  
ðŸ”¥ The Old Covenant had **barriers**â€”Jesus **tore them down**.  
ðŸ”¥ The priests had to offer **continual sacrifices**â€”Jesus **offered Himself once for all**.

The **shadows have passed away**â€”the reality is **Christ Himself**.

> _"These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ."_ (Colossians 2:17)

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Are the Dwelling Place of God**

Under the Old Covenant:

- Godâ€™s presence **was in a physical Tabernacle.**
- The High Priest **entered the Holy of Holies once a year.**
- Worship **was centered around a building.**

But under the New Covenant:  
âœ… **We are the temple of the Holy Spirit.**  
âœ… **We have direct access to the Father.**  
âœ… **Worship is not about a placeâ€”it is about Spirit and truth.**

> _"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?"_ (1 Corinthians 6:19)

This means:  
ðŸ”¥ **The presence of God is not in a templeâ€”it is in us.**  
ðŸ”¥ **We do not need priests to mediate for usâ€”Jesus is our Mediator.**  
ðŸ”¥ **We do not bring sacrificesâ€”Jesus was the final sacrifice.**

The Church must stop **trying to rebuild what Christ has already fulfilled** and start **walking in the full reality of the New Covenant.**

> _"God does not live in temples made by human hands."_ (Acts 17:24)

ðŸ”¥ **You donâ€™t need to go to a "holy place"â€”you are already the dwelling of God!**  
ðŸ”¥ **You donâ€™t need to seek a High Priestâ€”Jesus is your eternal Mediator!**  
ðŸ”¥ **You donâ€™t need to follow the old patternsâ€”walk in the fullness of Christ!**

#### **The Churchâ€™s Own Transition: From Old Covenant Thinking to Kingdom Reality**

Many believers today still live with an **Old Covenant mindset**:

- They **strive for forgiveness** when Jesus already **declared "It is finished."**
- They seek **external anointing** when the Holy Spirit already **lives inside them.**
- They look for **physical places to encounter God** when they **carry His presence.**

But the early Church understood **the radical shift of the New Covenant**.

ðŸ”¥ They did not go to the templeâ€”they **became the temple**.  
ðŸ”¥ They did not need priestsâ€”they **became a royal priesthood**.  
ðŸ”¥ They did not depend on sacrificesâ€”they **lived in the finished work of Christ**.

This is why Paul declared:

> _"You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."_ (1 Peter 2:5)

The Church must transition:  
âœ… **From visiting the presence of God to living in it daily.**  
âœ… **From following Old Covenant rituals to walking in New Covenant life.**  
âœ… **From striving for what Christ has already given to resting in His finished work.**

The **Tabernacle was a shadow**â€”the **Church is the reality**.

> _"Christ is faithful as the Son over Godâ€™s house. And we are His house."_ (Hebrews 3:6)

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Dwells in the Fullness of Christ**

The future of the Church **is not about rebuilding temples**â€”it is about **becoming the dwelling of Godâ€™s glory**.

Isaiah saw it:

> _"The whole earth is full of His glory!"_ (Isaiah 6:3)

Ezekiel saw it:

> _"I will put My Spirit in you and move you to follow My decrees."_ (Ezekiel 36:27)

John saw it:

> _"I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, â€˜Look! Godâ€™s dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them.â€™"_ (Revelation 21:2-3)

ðŸ”¥ The final temple **is not a buildingâ€”it is the Church glorified in Christ.**  
ðŸ”¥ The last move of God **is not about reviving old systemsâ€”it is about revealing the full Kingdom.**  
ðŸ”¥ The eternal destiny of the saints **is not in a tabernacleâ€”it is face-to-face communion with God.**

The Old Covenant was **a pattern**â€”the New Covenant is **the reality of Christ in us**.

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

In the fullness of time, the Church will not be **worshiping in shadows**â€”she will be **shining in the fullness of Christâ€™s glory**.

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, â€˜Come!â€™"_ (Revelation 22:17)
