**The Prophetic Calling** – Not about titles but about **revealing Christ’s nature**
_(Transitioning from Self-Exaltation to Revealing Christ’s Nature)_

#### **Introduction: The Prophetic Is Not a Title—It Is a Calling to Reveal Jesus**

The prophetic ministry is often misunderstood.

- Some see it as a **title**—a badge of honor that elevates them above others.
- Some see it as a **platform**—a way to gain influence and followers.
- Some see it as a **means of control**—using “Thus saith the Lord” to manipulate people.

But **true prophetic calling is not about recognition—it is about representation.**

> _"The testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."_ (Revelation 19:10)

This means:  
🔥 **Prophecy is not about predicting events—it is about pointing to Christ.**  
🔥 **Prophets are not meant to impress people—they are meant to reveal God’s heart.**  
🔥 **The goal of the prophetic is not to exalt the prophet—it is to bring people into alignment with Jesus.**

The Church must transition from **self-centered prophecy** to **Christ-centered revelation**.

> _"He must increase, but I must decrease."_ (John 3:30)

#### **Core Scripture: 1 Corinthians 14:3**

_"But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort."_

---

#### **The Christ Filter: The True Prophetic Reflects Jesus’ Heart**

Before Christ, prophetic ministry was often centered on:

- **Foretelling disasters**
- **Confronting corruption**
- **Announcing judgment**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined the prophetic**.

Instead of **just exposing sin**, He **revealed the Father’s love**.  
Instead of **just declaring judgment**, He **offered grace and truth**.  
Instead of **just speaking about the future**, He **became the fulfillment of prophecy itself**.

> _"Long ago, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many different ways. But now, in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son."_ (Hebrews 1:1-2)

🔥 This means prophecy today is not about **doom**—it is about **revealing Christ’s reign**.  
🔥 The role of a prophet is not to **condemn**—it is to **call people into the Father’s heart**.  
🔥 The greatest prophetic message is **not predicting world events—it is pointing people to Jesus**.

Jesus did not say, **"Go and make prophets."**  
He said, **"Go and make disciples."**

True prophecy does not create **followers of prophets**—it creates **followers of Christ**.

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Prophetic Is for All Believers**

Under the Old Covenant, **only a few were anointed as prophets**—Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah.

But under the New Covenant, **the Holy Spirit has been poured out on all believers**.

> _"In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy."_ (Acts 2:17)

🔥 This means **prophecy is not reserved for an elite few**—it is part of the Spirit-filled life.  
🔥 The prophetic is not about **titles**—it is about **listening to God and speaking His heart**.  
🔥 The purpose of prophecy is not to create **celebrities**—it is to build up the Church.

Paul declared:

> _"Eagerly desire the gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy."_ (1 Corinthians 14:1)

Why? Because true prophecy:  
✅ **Strengthens the Church** (1 Corinthians 14:3)  
✅ **Encourages believers** (1 Corinthians 14:3)  
✅ **Reveals the secrets of hearts and leads people to worship God** (1 Corinthians 14:24-25)

The prophetic is not about **showing off supernatural gifts**—it is about **bringing people closer to Jesus**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Title-Driven Prophecy to Kingdom-Focused Revelation**

Many in the Church today still think of prophecy as:  
❌ **A special office for a chosen few**  
❌ **A way to predict the future**  
❌ **A platform for personal influence**

But the early Church understood **prophecy was about building the Body of Christ**.

> _"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said."_ (1 Corinthians 14:29)

They knew:  
🔥 **Prophecy must be tested, not blindly followed.**  
🔥 **The goal is not mystical predictions, but edifying the Church.**  
🔥 **Prophets do not have absolute authority—Jesus is the final Word.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From chasing after prophets to maturing in Christ.**  
✅ **From self-promotion to self-denial.**  
✅ **From seeking supernatural experiences to seeking the heart of God.**

A prophetic word that does not:  
🔥 **Strengthen believers**  
🔥 **Encourage faith**  
🔥 **Call people into deeper intimacy with Jesus**

👉 **Is not from the Spirit of God.**

> _"For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of talk, but of power."_ (1 Corinthians 4:20)

True prophetic ministry is **not about talking—it is about revealing Christ’s reign.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Prophesies the Coming of Christ’s Fullness**

The future of the Church is **not built on prophetic celebrities**—it is built on a people who carry the Spirit of prophecy in daily life.

Moses saw it:

> _"I wish that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit on them!"_ (Numbers 11:29)

Joel saw it:

> _"Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions."_ (Joel 2:28)

John saw it:

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **The prophetic Church is not built around one man’s vision—it is built around Christ’s revelation.**  
🔥 **The final prophecy of the Church is not about doom—it is the Bride calling for Jesus to return.**  
🔥 **The last days will not be about confusion—they will be about a Church that clearly speaks the heart of the Father.**

The world will not end with **false prophets taking center stage**.  
The world will end with **a pure prophetic Bride calling for the fullness of Christ’s reign**.

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

The prophetic movement will not be known **for its most famous voices**—it will be known **for a people fully conformed to the image of Jesus**.

The greatest prophetic word is not, **“Look at me, I am a prophet.”**  
The greatest prophetic word is, **“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.”**

> _"Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches!"_ (Revelation 2:7)
