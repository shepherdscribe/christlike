**Spiritual Discernment & Testing Spirits** – **Does it look like Jesus?** If not, it’s not from God
_(Transitioning from Blind Acceptance to Christ-Centered Discernment)_

#### **Introduction: Not Every Spirit Is from God**

In every generation, **false teachings, deceptive spirits, and counterfeit revelations** have sought to lead God’s people astray.

- Some **use the name of Jesus** but preach a different gospel.
- Some **claim prophetic insight** but distort God’s heart.
- Some **perform miracles** but lack true intimacy with Christ.

But Scripture is clear:  
**Not every spiritual experience is from God.**

> _"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."_ (1 John 4:1)

Many today chase **spiritual experiences** without testing them.

- They believe a teaching **because it sounds good**.
- They follow a prophet **because they are accurate**.
- They trust supernatural encounters **without questioning the source**.

But discernment is **not about suspicion**—it is about **knowing the voice of Jesus so clearly that no counterfeit can deceive us**.

**The Church must transition from blind acceptance to Spirit-led discernment.**

#### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 5:14**

_"But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Is the Standard of Truth**

Before Jesus came, discernment was often about **law, rituals, and external signs**.

- The **Pharisees judged by religious rules**.
- The **prophets judged by national loyalty**.
- The **priests judged by temple sacrifices**.

But when Jesus came, He revealed that **true discernment is not based on external things—it is based on knowing Him**.

> _"My sheep hear My voice; I know them, and they follow Me."_ (John 10:27)

🔥 **This means every spirit must be tested by the character of Christ.**  
🔥 **Every prophecy must align with the love and truth of Jesus.**  
🔥 **Every revelation must lead to deeper intimacy with Him.**

Paul warned that **Satan masquerades as an angel of light** (2 Corinthians 11:14).

This means deception does not always come in **obvious evil**—it often comes in **something that looks almost right**.

**A true word from God will always:**  
✅ **Exalt Jesus, not man.**  
✅ **Align with Scripture, not contradict it.**  
✅ **Lead to righteousness, not confusion.**  
✅ **Build up the Church, not manipulate people.**

If a teaching, prophecy, or spiritual experience **does not pass the Christ filter, it is not from God**.

> _"For the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."_ (Revelation 19:10)

True spiritual discernment is not about **knowing all the wrong things**—it is about **knowing Jesus so well that no lie can deceive you**.

#### **New Covenant Reality: Every Believer Has the Spirit of Discernment**

Under the Old Covenant, discernment was limited to **prophets, priests, and kings**.

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Holy Spirit lives in every believer.**  
✅ **Every believer has access to divine wisdom.**  
✅ **Every believer can test and discern spiritual truth.**

Paul declared:

> _"The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things."_ (1 Corinthians 2:15)

John confirmed:

> _"You have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth."_ (1 John 2:20)

🔥 This means **you don’t need a prophet to tell you if something is from God—the Holy Spirit in you confirms it.**  
🔥 This means **you don’t need to fear deception—when you abide in Christ, He protects you from lies.**  
🔥 This means **spiritual leaders should equip believers to discern, not make them dependent on them.**

The Church must **stop treating discernment as a special gift for a few** and start training all believers **to test everything in the Spirit of Christ**.

> _"Do not quench the Spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt, but test them all; hold on to what is good, reject every kind of evil."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:19-22)

The greatest danger today is **not the presence of deception**—it is **the lack of discernment**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Blind Trust to Testing Everything in the Spirit**

Many churches today still operate with **unquestioned spiritual authority**:  
❌ They accept every prophecy without testing it.  
❌ They follow charismatic leaders without checking their doctrine.  
❌ They embrace supernatural manifestations without confirming the source.

But the early Church was trained **to test everything**.

Paul told the Corinthians:

> _"Even Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light."_ (2 Corinthians 11:14)

John warned:

> _"Many false prophets have gone out into the world."_ (1 John 4:1)

Jesus Himself said:

> _"Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the Kingdom of heaven."_ (Matthew 7:21)

🔥 The Church must transition from **trusting everything that looks spiritual** to **testing everything by the Spirit of Christ**.

This means:  
✅ **We test prophecy—not by accuracy, but by alignment with Jesus.**  
✅ **We test teachers—not by charisma, but by the fruit of their lives.**  
✅ **We test spiritual experiences—not by power, but by their effect on holiness.**

If a spiritual leader:  
❌ **Exalts themselves instead of Christ**  
❌ **Preaches power without love**  
❌ **Leads people into confusion instead of clarity**

👉 **They are not operating by the Spirit of God.**

The Holy Spirit leads us **into all truth** (John 16:13)—not into manipulation, fear, or control.

The goal is not **to reject all supernatural experiences**—it is **to discern which ones are truly from the Father**.

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Wisdom, Not Deception**

The future of the Church is **not one of confusion—it is one of clarity**.

Isaiah saw it:

> _"Whether you turn to the right or the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.’"_ (Isaiah 30:21)

Jesus promised it:

> _"When He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth."_ (John 16:13)

John saw it:

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **The end-time Church will not be confused—it will walk in divine discernment.**  
🔥 **The Spirit-filled Bride will not be deceived—she will know the voice of her Beloved.**  
🔥 **The last great deception will not defeat the Church—she will stand in the fullness of wisdom and truth.**

The last days will not be marked **by a Church running after false signs and wonders**—they will be marked **by a people so aligned with Christ that they cannot be led astray**.

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

The Spirit is not giving us **fear of deception**—He is giving us **the wisdom to walk in truth**.

> _"Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches!"_ (Revelation 2:7)
