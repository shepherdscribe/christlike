### **The Spirit of Revelation: Growing in Prophetic Wisdom & Understanding**

_(Transitioning from Information-Based Faith to Spirit-Led Revelation & Discernment)_

---

### **Introduction: The Need for Revelation in the Church**

Many believers today **settle for knowledge but lack true revelation**, leading to these issues:  
❌ **Some treat faith as intellectual, missing the Spirit’s voice in daily life.**  
❌ **Others chase experiences but have no depth of wisdom or understanding.**  
❌ **Many rely on past knowledge of God instead of fresh revelation for today.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **Revelation is not just knowing facts—it is knowing God personally.**  
🔥 **Wisdom is not human intelligence—it is divine insight that leads to transformation.**  
🔥 **Understanding is not just about doctrine—it is about seeing the deeper meaning of what God is doing.**

> _"The Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better."_ (Ephesians 1:17)

🔥 **The Church must transition from religious information to Spirit-led revelation and discernment.**

### **Core Scripture: Proverbs 4:7**

_"The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding."_

🔥 **Knowledge alone is not enough—we need wisdom and understanding.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus as the Source of All Revelation**

Before Christ, people had **limited understanding of God’s ways**:  
🔥 **The Law revealed God’s holiness, but not the fullness of His grace.**  
🔥 **Prophets saw glimpses of the Messiah but did not fully grasp His mission.**  
🔥 **Many religious leaders had knowledge but lacked intimacy with God.**

But when Jesus came, He **unlocked true wisdom and revelation**:  
🔥 **He revealed the Father’s heart, showing that love is the highest law (John 14:9).**  
🔥 **He spoke in parables, requiring spiritual insight to understand (Matthew 13:10-11).**  
🔥 **He gave His disciples authority, but also the wisdom to walk in it (Luke 10:19-20).**

> _"All things have been committed to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."_ (Matthew 11:27)

🔥 **Jesus did not just bring knowledge—He revealed the heart of the Father.**

This means:  
✅ **Prophetic wisdom is not just about hearing—it is about perceiving what God is truly saying.**  
✅ **True revelation leads to transformation, not just information.**  
✅ **Jesus is the source of all wisdom, and the Spirit reveals what is hidden.**

> _"The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life."_ (John 6:63)

🔥 **The Church must transition from hearing words to receiving revelation that transforms.**

### **New Covenant Reality: Revelation Is for All Who Walk in the Spirit**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Revelation was given primarily to prophets, priests, and kings.**
- **Understanding was limited, as the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out.**
- **God spoke through external means (angels, burning bushes, visions) but not directly within people.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Holy Spirit now dwells in every believer, making revelation available to all.**  
✅ **Wisdom and understanding are part of the Spirit’s work in transforming us.**  
✅ **We no longer depend on external signs—God speaks directly to our spirit.**

Paul declared:

> _"What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived—the things God has prepared for those who love Him—these are the things God has revealed to us by His Spirit."_ (1 Corinthians 2:9-10)

🔥 **Revelation is not about mystical experiences—it is about intimacy with God.**

This means:  
✅ **The Spirit is the one who opens our minds to Scripture and God’s will.**  
✅ **Understanding the deeper things of God requires both study and Spirit-led revelation.**  
✅ **Revelation is given to those who seek it, not just to those who know doctrine.**

> _"You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart."_ (Jeremiah 29:13)

🔥 **The Church must transition from relying only on human intellect to walking in the Spirit of wisdom and revelation.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Religious Knowledge to Spirit-Led Revelation**

Many believers still misunderstand **what it means to walk in revelation**:  
❌ **Some think revelation is only for a select few (prophets, leaders, scholars).**  
❌ **Others assume knowledge alone is enough, missing the Spirit’s voice.**  
❌ **Many fear new revelation, thinking it contradicts tradition.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **They could not build the Church on human wisdom alone—they needed the Spirit’s revelation.**  
🔥 **They constantly sought wisdom, not just information, for decisions and guidance.**  
🔥 **The Gospel spread not just through teaching, but through the Spirit’s power and revelation.**

Paul wrote:

> _"I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ."_ (Galatians 1:12)

🔥 **True Kingdom expansion happens when believers walk in fresh revelation, not just old knowledge.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From studying the Word only intellectually to encountering the Spirit of the Word.**  
✅ **From limiting revelation to theology to embracing God’s voice in everyday life.**  
✅ **From fearing fresh revelation to testing and embracing truth that aligns with Christ.**

> _"The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."_ (2 Corinthians 3:6)

🔥 **The Word without revelation is lifeless, but revelation through the Spirit brings transformation.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Continuous Revelation**

The final destiny of the Church is **not just to know doctrine, but to walk in divine revelation daily.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

Jesus declared it:

> _"The Spirit of truth will guide you into all truth… He will take what is Mine and declare it to you."_ (John 16:13-14)

Paul revealed it:

> _"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better."_ (Ephesians 1:17)

🔥 **The Church is not called to function on past knowledge—it is called to walk in fresh revelation from God daily.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not just about remembering—it is about being transformed by what is revealed.**  
🔥 **We are not meant to live on secondhand revelation—we are called to personally walk in the Spirit of wisdom.**

The world will not end **with a Church full of information**—  
🔥 **It will end with a Church that fully knows and walks in the revelation of Christ!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **We are not called to just study the Word—we are called to walk in the Spirit of revelation and wisdom!**
