### **The Church as a Prophetic People**

_(Transitioning from Prophecy as a Gift for a Few to a Calling for the Entire Church)_
### **Introduction: Prophecy is Not Just for a Select Few**

Many believers today misunderstand prophecy in one of three ways:  
❌ **Some think prophecy is only for prophets or "anointed" leaders.**  
❌ **Others assume prophecy is only about predicting the future.**  
❌ **Many believe prophecy is rare or unnecessary now that we have Scripture.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **Prophecy is not just for a select few—it is part of the Spirit-filled life.**  
🔥 **The early Church was a prophetic people, not just led by a few prophetic voices.**  
🔥 **The New Covenant promise is that all believers would hear and speak what God is revealing.**

> _"I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams."_ (Acts 2:17)

🔥 **The Church must transition from prophecy being for a few to prophecy being the identity of the Body of Christ.**

### **Core Scripture: Numbers 11:29**

_"I wish that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit on them!"_

🔥 **What Moses longed for in the Old Testament is fulfilled in the New Covenant!**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Made Prophecy Accessible to All Believers**

Before Christ, prophecy was:  
🔥 **Limited to specific individuals (prophets, priests, and kings).**  
🔥 **Given in part, as the fullness of God's plan was not yet revealed.**  
🔥 **Used to guide Israel, foretell the Messiah, and declare divine warnings.**

But when Jesus came, He **changed the way prophecy functioned**:  
🔥 **He became the fullness of God’s revelation (Hebrews 1:1-3).**  
🔥 **He released the Holy Spirit to all believers, making prophecy available to everyone (John 16:13).**  
🔥 **He declared that His sheep would hear His voice and follow Him (John 10:27).**

> _"No longer will a man teach his neighbor, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest."_ (Hebrews 8:11)

🔥 **Jesus did not come to restrict prophecy—He came to multiply it!**

This means:  
✅ **Prophecy is not about status—it is about relationship with God.**  
✅ **Prophecy is not limited to foretelling events—it is about revealing Christ.**  
✅ **Every believer can now walk in prophetic awareness because of the Holy Spirit.**

> _"For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."_ (Revelation 19:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from prophecy being a rare gift to prophecy being a common reality.**

### **New Covenant Reality: The Church is a Prophetic People**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Only certain people had the Spirit resting on them.**
- **Prophecy was given in part, waiting for the full revelation of Christ.**
- **People depended on prophets to hear from God on their behalf.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Spirit is poured out on all believers (Acts 2:17-18).**  
✅ **Every believer has access to revelation through the Holy Spirit (John 14:26).**  
✅ **Prophecy is meant to build up, encourage, and strengthen the entire Church (1 Corinthians 14:3).**

Paul declared:

> _"Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy."_ (1 Corinthians 14:1)

🔥 **Prophecy is not an optional gift—it is something we should all desire!**

This means:  
✅ **Every believer can hear God’s voice and share what He reveals.**  
✅ **Prophecy is not reserved for church services—it is part of daily life.**  
✅ **The Church is not meant to follow one or two prophetic voices—we are all called to live in the Spirit of prophecy.**

> _"You may all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged."_ (1 Corinthians 14:31)

🔥 **The Church must transition from following prophets to becoming a prophetic people.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Spectators to Prophetic Participants**

Many believers still **misunderstand their prophetic identity**:  
❌ **Some wait for others to give them prophetic words instead of hearing God for themselves.**  
❌ **Others think prophecy is only for church leaders rather than for the whole Body of Christ.**  
❌ **Many do not realize that walking in prophetic revelation is normal for Spirit-filled believers.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **They relied on the Spirit’s guidance, not just human wisdom.**  
🔥 **They encouraged all believers to grow in prophecy.**  
🔥 **They did not elevate prophets above others—they saw prophecy as a function of the whole Body.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Do not quench the Spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt but test them all; hold on to what is good."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21)

🔥 **Prophecy is not something to fear—it is something to embrace and discern.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From expecting prophecy from a few to expecting it from the Body.**  
✅ **From waiting for a word from God to walking in continuous revelation.**  
✅ **From prophecy as an event to prophecy as a way of life.**

> _"For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears."_ (1 Corinthians 13:9-10)

🔥 **The Church is growing in maturity, and prophecy is part of that process.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Continuous Prophetic Revelation**

The final destiny of the Church is **not a few prophets speaking, but an entire prophetic people manifesting God’s will on earth.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring, and My blessing on your descendants. They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams."_ (Isaiah 44:3-4)

Jesus declared it:

> _"My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me."_ (John 10:27)

Paul revealed it:

> _"Until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."_ (Ephesians 4:13)

🔥 **The Church is not called to follow prophets—it is called to be a prophetic people.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not just about knowing doctrine—it is about walking in revelation.**  
🔥 **We are not meant to wait for divine encounters—we are meant to live in them daily.**

The world will not end **with a silent Church**—  
🔥 **It will end with a prophetic Bride declaring, “Come, Lord Jesus!”**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **We are not just meant to listen to prophecy—we are called to be a prophetic Church!**
