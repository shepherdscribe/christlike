Knowing the Times and Seasons: The Sons of Issachar & The Church’s Call to Discernment
_(Transitioning from Prophetic Speculation to Kingdom Discernment & Action)_

---

### **Introduction: Are We Paying Attention to What God Is Doing?**

Many believers struggle with how to interpret **the times and seasons**, often falling into one of two extremes:  
❌ **Some obsess over prophetic speculation, constantly chasing signs without clear direction.**  
❌ **Others completely ignore the need for discernment, assuming everything is random.**  
❌ **Many do not realize that knowing the times is not about fear—it is about alignment with God’s purposes.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **God desires His people to walk in discernment, not confusion.**  
🔥 **Understanding the times is not about predicting the future—it is about aligning with God’s present move.**  
🔥 **Prophetic awareness leads to wisdom and action, not fear and passivity.**

> _"The sons of Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do."_ (1 Chronicles 12:32)

🔥 **The Church must transition from speculation to wisdom-driven discernment and Kingdom action.**

### **Core Scripture: Ecclesiastes 3:1**

_"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens."_

🔥 **Understanding seasons is about discerning what God is doing and responding accordingly.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Taught His Disciples to Discern the Times**

Before Christ, people interpreted signs and seasons in different ways:  
🔥 **The Pharisees studied the Law but failed to recognize the Messiah standing before them.**  
🔥 **The religious leaders demanded signs but ignored the prophetic fulfillment in Jesus.**  
🔥 **Many expected a military savior, but Jesus came to establish a spiritual Kingdom first.**

But when Jesus came, He **challenged people to discern the times**:  
🔥 **He rebuked the Pharisees for missing the signs of His coming (Matthew 16:2-3).**  
🔥 **He warned His disciples about being spiritually blind (Luke 19:41-44).**  
🔥 **He taught that those who walk in the Spirit would recognize the season they were in.**

> _"You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."_ (Matthew 16:3)

🔥 **Jesus made it clear that spiritual discernment is just as critical as recognizing physical seasons.**

This means:  
✅ **God is always moving, but not everyone perceives it.**  
✅ **We must seek the Spirit’s wisdom, not just human speculation.**  
✅ **Knowing the times is not about panic—it is about preparation and obedience.**

> _"Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets."_ (Amos 3:7)

🔥 **The Church must transition from reacting to world events in fear to interpreting them through the lens of the Kingdom.**

### **New Covenant Reality: The Spirit Gives Us Insight into the Times**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **God spoke through prophets and signs.**
- **People relied on religious leaders to interpret divine seasons.**
- **Revelation was often limited to certain individuals.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Holy Spirit dwells in every believer, giving wisdom and discernment.**  
✅ **We no longer need a select few to interpret the times—God reveals His purposes through His Body, the Church.**  
✅ **Prophetic insight is available to all who walk in the Spirit.**

Paul declared:

> _"But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:4-5)

🔥 **God’s people are not supposed to be caught off guard—we are called to be spiritually aware.**

This means:  
✅ **We are not guessing the future—we are aligning with God’s revealed purposes.**  
✅ **We are not moved by fear—we are led by revelation.**  
✅ **We do not panic over world events—we discern and respond in faith.**

> _"The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him, and He will show them His covenant."_ (Psalm 25:14)

🔥 **The Church must transition from spiritual blindness to prophetic awareness and alignment.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Fearful Speculation to Kingdom Strategy**

Many believers still live with **an unclear understanding of the times**:  
❌ **Some consume endless "prophetic news" but take no action in their own spiritual growth.**  
❌ **Others dismiss prophetic insight altogether, assuming everything is random.**  
❌ **Many see world events but fail to recognize God’s hand in them.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The Holy Spirit gives wisdom to interpret what God is doing.**  
🔥 **Seasons of difficulty or favor are opportunities for Kingdom advancement.**  
🔥 **God does not just reveal signs—He calls us to act in obedience.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil."_ (Ephesians 5:15-16)

🔥 **Wisdom is not just knowing the times—it is knowing how to respond to them.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From chasing signs to discerning God’s movement.**  
✅ **From fearing change to walking in faith.**  
✅ **From passive waiting to active Kingdom engagement.**

> _"So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom."_ (Psalm 90:12)

🔥 **Knowing the times should lead to wisdom-driven action, not passive speculation.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Prophetic Discernment**

The final destiny of the Church is **not confusion and panic—it is walking in clarity and alignment with God’s purposes.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?"_ (Isaiah 43:19)

Jesus declared it:

> _"When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."_ (Luke 21:28)

Paul revealed it:

> _"Now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known."_ (1 Corinthians 13:12)

🔥 **The Church is not called to be blind to the times—we are called to walk in prophetic clarity.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about escaping the world—it is about advancing the Kingdom in every season.**  
🔥 **We are not waiting in uncertainty—we are preparing for the fullness of God’s purposes.**

The world will not end **with believers caught unaware**—  
🔥 **It will end with a discerning Church that knows the times and walks in Kingdom authority!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not confused—  
🔥 **She is watching, waiting, and moving in sync with the heart of her King!**
