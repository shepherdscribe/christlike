### **The Open Heaven: Walking in Continuous Prophetic Awareness**

_(Transitioning from Limited Encounters to a Lifestyle of Divine Revelation)_
### **Introduction: What If Heaven Wasn’t Far Away?**

Many believers live as if:  
❌ **God is distant, and heaven is only accessible after death.**  
❌ **Prophetic encounters are rare and only for special people.**  
❌ **Supernatural experiences are occasional rather than a normal part of life.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **Jesus opened the heavens permanently—we now have direct access to the Father.**  
🔥 **The veil was torn, meaning divine encounters are no longer limited to a few.**  
🔥 **Prophetic awareness is not just for certain moments—it is a continuous reality for Spirit-filled believers.**

> _"Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."_ (John 1:51)

🔥 **The Church must transition from occasional glimpses of God’s presence to living in an open heaven reality.**

### **Core Scripture: Matthew 3:16-17**

_"As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on Him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased.’"_

🔥 **Jesus walked in an open heaven reality, and we are called to do the same.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Removed the Barrier Between Heaven & Earth**

Before Christ, heaven was often seen as distant:  
🔥 **God’s presence was limited to the Holy of Holies in the temple.**  
🔥 **Prophets occasionally had open heaven encounters, but not everyone.**  
🔥 **Most people related to God through priests rather than direct access.**

But when Jesus came, He **permanently opened heaven**:  
🔥 **He tore the veil, granting all believers access to God (Matthew 27:51).**  
🔥 **He declared that we would see greater things through the Spirit (John 14:12).**  
🔥 **He lived in continuous connection with the Father and invited us into that same reality.**

> _"I only do what I see My Father doing."_ (John 5:19)

🔥 **Jesus’ life was a model of what it looks like to walk under an open heaven.**

This means:  
✅ **The supernatural is not distant—it is accessible through Christ.**  
✅ **The veil is torn—heaven is not far, it is here now.**  
✅ **Every believer is invited to walk in a prophetic awareness of God’s presence.**

> _"For through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit."_ (Ephesians 2:18)

🔥 **The Church must transition from waiting for encounters to living in continuous revelation.**

### **New Covenant Reality: Heaven is Open, and We Are Citizens of It**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Heaven was separated from humanity, and God’s presence was localized.**
- **Only prophets, priests, and kings had direct encounters.**
- **People looked forward to a future hope of being with God.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **We are already seated in heavenly places with Christ (Ephesians 2:6).**  
✅ **The Holy Spirit dwells in us, meaning heaven’s presence is within (1 Corinthians 3:16).**  
✅ **We don’t just wait for heaven—we bring heaven to earth.**

Paul declared:

> _"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."_ (Colossians 3:1)

🔥 **We don’t just visit heaven—we live from it.**

This means:  
✅ **Spiritual encounters are not occasional—they should be a way of life.**  
✅ **We don’t need to strive for access to God—we already have it.**  
✅ **The supernatural is not the exception—it is the believer’s normal reality.**

> _"Your Kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."_ (Matthew 6:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from waiting for heaven to manifesting heaven on earth.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Limited Encounters to Daily Awareness**

Many believers still think **heaven is distant and God’s presence is occasional**:  
❌ **Some think only "spiritual people" can have divine encounters.**  
❌ **Others assume we must wait for heaven to experience God fully.**  
❌ **Many fail to cultivate an awareness of God’s presence in daily life.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The Holy Spirit made open heaven living accessible to all believers.**  
🔥 **Every believer is called to walk in continuous fellowship with God.**  
🔥 **The supernatural was not rare—it was expected (Acts 2:17-18).**

Paul wrote:

> _"Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit."_ (Ephesians 5:18)

🔥 **To be filled means to live under an open heaven, aware of His presence.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From limited encounters to a daily awareness of heaven’s reality.**  
✅ **From thinking we visit God’s presence to knowing we live in it.**  
✅ **From waiting for heaven to breaking it into the earth.**

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

🔥 **The Church is not meant to wait for revival—it is called to live in an open heaven reality.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Continuous Revelation**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to live separated from heaven but to fully integrate heaven and earth.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"The Lord will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end."_ (Isaiah 60:20)

Jesus declared it:

> _"You will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."_ (John 1:51)

Paul revealed it:

> _"For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet."_ (1 Corinthians 15:25)

🔥 **The Church is not waiting for an open heaven—it is already living in it!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about waiting for the supernatural—it is about walking in it now.**  
🔥 **We are not meant to be distant from heaven—we are meant to manifest it on earth.**

The world will not end **with believers waiting for the supernatural**—  
🔥 **It will end with a Church fully manifesting the glory of heaven on earth!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **We are not meant to be occasional visitors of heaven—we are carriers of its reality!**
