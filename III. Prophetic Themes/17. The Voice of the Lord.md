**The Voice of the Lord** – God speaks, but **Christ is the final Word**
_(Transitioning from Religious Noise to True Prophetic Revelation in Christ)_

#### **Introduction: A World of Competing Voices**

In every generation, people have claimed to **speak for God**.

- Prophets declare **end-time disasters**.
- Preachers claim **direct revelations**.
- Social media is filled with **“Thus says the Lord” proclamations**.

But in a world of competing voices, **who is truly speaking for God?**

The Bible warns:  
❌ **Not every voice claiming to be prophetic is from God.**  
❌ **Not every supernatural revelation is from the Holy Spirit.**  
❌ **Not every "word from the Lord" reflects His true heart.**

Many seek **words from God**, but they do not **seek the God who speaks**.

The true **voice of the Lord** is not found in religious noise—it is found in **Jesus Christ, the Final Word**.

> _"In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son."_ (Hebrews 1:1-2)

If it does not **sound like Jesus**,  
If it does not **align with Jesus**,  
If it does not **reveal Jesus**,

**Then it is not the true voice of the Lord.**

#### **Core Scripture: John 10:27**

_"My sheep hear My voice; I know them, and they follow Me."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus is the Final Word**

Before Christ, **God’s voice was heard through prophets, visions, and signs**.

- **Moses** heard God through the burning bush.
- **Elijah** heard Him as a whisper in the cave.
- **Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel** received divine messages to call Israel to repentance.

But when Jesus came, **everything changed**.

He was not just **another prophet**—He was **the fullness of God’s voice in human form**.

> _"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."_ (John 1:14)

This means:  
✅ **Jesus is the clearest revelation of who God is.**  
✅ **Jesus is the filter for all prophecy.**  
✅ **Jesus is the voice of the Father, revealing His heart.**

If a prophetic word does not **reflect the nature of Christ**,  
If a preacher’s message does not **lead people deeper into Christ**,  
If a dream or vision does not **align with the heart of Christ**,

👉 **It is not the true voice of the Lord.**

> _"He who has seen Me has seen the Father."_ (John 14:9)

The ultimate test of prophecy is not **signs and wonders**—it is **whether it leads people into the heart of Christ**.

#### **New Covenant Reality: Every Believer Can Hear His Voice**

Under the Old Covenant, **only prophets, priests, and kings heard God directly**.

But under the New Covenant, Jesus changed everything:

> _"My sheep hear My voice."_ (John 10:27)

This means:  
✅ **Hearing God is not reserved for a special group—it is for all believers.**  
✅ **The Holy Spirit teaches and leads every child of God.**  
✅ **You don’t need a mediator—Jesus has given you direct access to the Father.**

> _"The anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all things… remain in Him."_ (1 John 2:27)

This is the transition the Church must embrace:

- **From relying on prophets to relying on the Holy Spirit.**
- **From chasing after "words" to abiding in Christ’s Word.**
- **From seeking new revelations to growing in the full revelation of Jesus.**

The Holy Spirit **does speak**, but He always speaks in alignment with:  
✅ **The character of Jesus**  
✅ **The truth of Scripture**  
✅ **The heart of the Father**

> _"But when He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on His own; He will speak only what He hears and will tell you what is yet to come."_ (John 16:13)

True prophetic revelation is **not about predicting the future**—it is about **revealing Jesus and His Kingdom**.

---

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Religious Noise to True Prophetic Discernment**

Many in the Church today are still **chasing after voices, visions, and experiences**, but they are **not testing the spirits**.

- Some follow **prophets who predict disasters and political shifts**, rather than **seeking the voice of Christ**.
- Some chase **supernatural encounters**, rather than **maturing in Christlikeness**.
- Some assume **any spiritual revelation is from God**, rather than **discerning its source**.

But the early Church was **trained to test every spirit**:

> _"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God."_ (1 John 4:1)

Jesus warned:

> _"Many false prophets will appear and deceive many."_ (Matthew 24:11)

This is why the Church must transition:  
✅ **From blindly trusting every voice to discerning through Christ.**  
✅ **From chasing after "new revelations" to being rooted in the finished work of Jesus.**  
✅ **From sensationalism to Spirit-led wisdom and maturity.**

A prophetic word that does not lead to:  
🔥 **Repentance**  
🔥 **Love for Jesus**  
🔥 **Spiritual growth in Christ**

👉 **Is not from God.**

> _"For the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."_ (Revelation 19:10)

---

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in True Revelation**

The future of the Church is **not built on sensational prophecies**—it is built on the **unshakable foundation of Christ**.

Joel saw it:

> _"I will pour out My Spirit on all people; your sons and daughters will prophesy… I will pour out My Spirit in those days."_ (Joel 2:28-29)

Isaiah saw it:

> _"Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.’"_ (Isaiah 30:21)

John saw it:

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

This means:  
🔥 **The true prophetic movement is not about fame—it is about intimacy with Jesus.**  
🔥 **The Church is not led by human opinions—it is led by the voice of the Shepherd.**  
🔥 **The Bride of Christ is not confused—she is fully tuned to the voice of her Beloved.**

The world will not end with **false prophets deceiving the Church**.  
The world will end with **a pure, Spirit-filled Bride walking in the full revelation of Christ**.

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

The voice of the Lord is **not found in religious noise**—it is found in **the still, clear voice of Jesus, leading His people into glory**.

> _"He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."_ (Revelation 2:7)
