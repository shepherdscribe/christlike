**The Scroll & The Lion-Lamb** – The Book of Revelation isn’t about doom, but **about the Lamb’s victory**
_(Transitioning from Fear-Based Eschatology to Christ’s Victory & Authority)_

#### **Introduction: The Sealed Scroll and the Weeping of John**

In **Revelation 5**, John is caught up in **a dramatic vision of Heaven**. Before him, he sees **a scroll sealed with seven seals**, resting in the right hand of God.

A mighty angel calls out:

> _"Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?"_

But no one—**not in heaven, not on earth, nor under the earth**—was found worthy to open it.

John begins to **weep bitterly**.

Why? Because the scroll represents **God’s redemptive plan for the world**—His justice, His covenant, His inheritance for the saints.

- If no one can open the scroll, **God’s purposes remain unfulfilled**.
- If no one can open the scroll, **the world remains under bondage**.
- If no one can open the scroll, **creation cannot be restored**.

But suddenly, John hears the words that would change everything:

> _"Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."_ (Revelation 5:5)

John expects to see **a roaring, conquering Lion**… but instead, he turns and sees **a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain**.

🔥 **This is the great mystery of Christ’s authority**:  
He is not just the Lion—**He is the slain Lamb who has overcome by sacrifice**.

#### **Core Scripture: Revelation 5:9-10**

_"You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because You were slain, and with Your blood You purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus’ Authority Comes Through the Cross**

Before Jesus, the world understood **power through conquest**.

- Kingdoms were won by **military strength**.
- Kings ruled by **domination and force**.
- The **Messiah** was expected to come as a warrior, destroying Rome.

But Jesus **did not conquer by violence—He conquered through the Cross**.

> _"For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."_ (1 Corinthians 1:25)

🔥 This means Jesus **did not overcome by force—He overcame by love.**  
🔥 This means the Kingdom **does not advance by war—it advances by sacrifice.**  
🔥 This means the final victory of God **is not in destruction—it is in restoration.**

The slain Lamb is the **only one worthy** to open the scroll because:  
✅ **He fulfilled the Law completely.**  
✅ **He paid for sin with His own blood.**  
✅ **He disarmed the powers of darkness through His death.**

This is why Jesus said:

> _"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me."_ (Matthew 28:18)

The world expects **a Lion to conquer with violence**—but the Kingdom is won **through the power of the Lamb**.

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Kingdom Advances Through the Blood of the Lamb**

Many people today still see **end-times prophecy as a coming reign of terror**.

❌ They believe the world is destined for **uncontrollable destruction**.  
❌ They fear that **Satan has more power than Christ.**  
❌ They think the Book of Revelation is about **the defeat of the Church**.

But Revelation **does not show the Church being defeated—it shows the Church reigning with Christ!**

> _"They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death."_ (Revelation 12:11)

🔥 The Lamb’s sacrifice **was not weakness—it was victory.**  
🔥 The blood of Jesus **does not just forgive—it conquers.**  
🔥 The final war is **not fought with swords, but with the Gospel and the faith of the saints.**

This means:  
✅ **The Kingdom is not coming through war—it is coming through the witness of the Church.**  
✅ **Satan is not rising in power—he has already been defeated at the Cross.**  
✅ **The scroll is not waiting to be opened—Jesus has already taken it!**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Fear-Based Eschatology to Christ-Centered Victory**

Many believers still think **the last days are about doom, destruction, and despair**.

- They see Revelation as **a book of terror** instead of **a book of Christ’s triumph**.
- They live in **fear of the Antichrist** instead of **confidence in the reign of Christ**.
- They preach **the rise of evil** more than **the victory of the Lamb**.

But the early Church did not live in **fear of the future**—they lived in **faith that Christ had already won**.

🔥 **John wept because he thought no one could open the scroll—but Jesus already had!**  
🔥 **The Church is not waiting for victory—victory was won at the Cross!**  
🔥 **The last days are not about escaping the world—they are about Christ redeeming the world.**

This is why Jesus declared:

> _"I am making all things new!"_ (Revelation 21:5)

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From fearing the future to trusting in Christ’s rule.**  
✅ **From focusing on destruction to preaching restoration.**  
✅ **From waiting for the Kingdom to realizing it is already advancing.**

The Lion-Lamb is already seated on the throne.  
The scroll is already in His hands.  
The Church is already reigning with Him.

> _"You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth."_ (Revelation 5:10)

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Reigns with Christ**

The future of the Church is **not defeat—it is dominion in Christ**.

Daniel saw it:

> _"The saints of the Most High will receive the Kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, forever and ever!"_ (Daniel 7:18)

Isaiah saw it:

> _"Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end."_ (Isaiah 9:7)

John saw it:

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

🔥 The Church will not be overcome—we will reign with Christ!  
🔥 The Kingdom will not fade—it will expand until all things are restored!  
🔥 The Book of Revelation does not end with disaster—it ends with the New Creation!

The final victory **belongs to the Lamb who was slain.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The last great prophetic cry **is not about escaping the world**—it is about welcoming the fullness of Christ’s Kingdom.

And in the fullness of time, the Church will not be **hiding from the enemy**—she will be **reigning in the presence of her King.**

> _"To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with My Father on His throne."_ (Revelation 3:21)

The **Lion has conquered**.  
The **Lamb has redeemed**.  
The **Kingdom is advancing**.

**The scroll is not sealed anymore—it is in the hands of Jesus.**
