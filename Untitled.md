The Septuagint's phrase "angels of God" aligns with the Dead Sea Scrolls' "sons of God," suggesting that divine beings were assigned to oversee the nations, while Yahweh retained Israel as His special possession. This contrasts with the Masoretic Text's "sons of Israel," which may reflect a theological shift to emphasize Israel's central role. ​[en.wikipedia.org+1Logos Bible Study+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_God?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These textual differences have led scholars to explore how ancient Israel perceived divine governance and the nation's unique relationship with Yahweh.
