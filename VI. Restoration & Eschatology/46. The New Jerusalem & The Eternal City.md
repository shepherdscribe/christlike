Chapter 7: City
**The New Jerusalem & the Eternal City** – This isn’t a future city—it’s **the Church living in Christ**
_(Transitioning from a Physical City Expectation to the Reality of the Church as God’s Dwelling Place)_

#### **Introduction: The City of God Revealed**

For many believers, **the New Jerusalem is often misunderstood** as:  
❌ **A physical city that will descend from heaven in the future.**  
❌ **A distant hope rather than a present reality.**  
❌ **A place of escape instead of a picture of God dwelling among His people.**

But Scripture paints **a different vision**:  
🔥 **The New Jerusalem is not just a future city—it is the redeemed people of God.**  
🔥 **God’s eternal dwelling is not in a distant place—it is in His Church.**  
🔥 **Heaven is not separate from earth—it is merging with it.**

> _"I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband."_ (Revelation 21:2)

🔥 **The Church must transition from waiting for a city to realizing we are the city.**

#### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 12:22-23**

_"But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The New Jerusalem Is the Bride, Not Just a Place**

Before Christ, people expected:  
🔥 **A restored physical Jerusalem where God’s presence would dwell.**  
🔥 **A city where the Messiah would rule over the nations.**  
🔥 **A place of pilgrimage where the faithful would worship.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined the vision**:  
🔥 **The New Jerusalem is not about geography—it is about the redeemed community.**  
🔥 **It is not about rebuilding a physical Temple—it is about God’s Spirit dwelling in His people.**  
🔥 **It is not about a city for one nation—it is a Kingdom for all nations.**

> _"Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?"_ (1 Corinthians 3:16)

🔥 **The New Jerusalem is not something we enter—it is something we become.**

This means:  
✅ **We are not waiting for a golden city—we are living stones in God’s dwelling place.**  
✅ **We are not just heading to heaven—we are manifesting heaven on earth.**  
✅ **We are not just looking forward to the presence of God—we carry His presence now.**

> _"Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people."_ (Revelation 21:3)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a physical city mindset to living as the dwelling place of God now.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Church Is the City of God**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Jerusalem was the central place of worship.**
- **The Temple was the dwelling place of God’s presence.**
- **The city’s walls and laws symbolized separation from the nations.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Church is now the dwelling place of God.**  
✅ **The walls of separation have been torn down—now all nations are welcome.**  
✅ **God’s presence is not in a building—it is within His people.**

Paul declared:

> _"Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of His household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone."_ (Ephesians 2:19-20)

🔥 **The New Jerusalem is not a future place—it is the community of those in Christ.**

This means:  
✅ **The Church is not peripheral to God’s plan—it is the fulfillment of His city.**  
✅ **The Kingdom is not coming from the sky—it is unfolding through His people.**  
✅ **We do not go to the New Jerusalem—it is coming into fullness in us.**

> _"For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come."_ (Hebrews 13:14)

🔥 **The Church must transition from expecting an external kingdom to realizing we are the New Jerusalem.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Earthly Citizenship to Kingdom Identity**

Many believers still live with **a limited understanding of their role in the Kingdom**:  
❌ **They see their identity as temporary rather than eternal.**  
❌ **They wait for God’s presence to come rather than walking in it.**  
❌ **They view the Church as a gathering place instead of the eternal city of God.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **They were already citizens of heaven.**  
🔥 **They were already part of the New Jerusalem.**  
🔥 **They were already living in the Kingdom reality.**

Paul wrote:

> _"But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Philippians 3:20)

🔥 **We are not just waiting to live in the city of God—we are the city of God!**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From waiting for a future city to recognizing our present identity.**  
✅ **From thinking of heaven as "somewhere else" to knowing it is already here in part.**  
✅ **From waiting for a final transformation to living as transformed people now.**

> _"You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession."_ (1 Peter 2:9)

🔥 **We are not waiting for the New Jerusalem—we are being built into it!**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Full Revelation of the City of God**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to live in a separate city but to be the dwelling place of God in fullness.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"Your gates will always stand open, they will never be shut, day or night, so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations."_ (Isaiah 60:11)

John saw it:

> _"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp."_ (Revelation 21:23)

Jesus declared it:

> _"I go and prepare a place for you… that where I am, you may be also."_ (John 14:3)

🔥 **The Church is not waiting to enter the New Jerusalem—we are being transformed into it!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about a distant kingdom—it is about a present and future reality.**  
🔥 **We are not looking for a physical city—we are becoming the radiant Bride of Christ!**

The world will not end **with believers waiting for a city to descend**—  
🔥 **It will end with the Church fully revealed as the dwelling place of God.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not searching for the city—  
🔥 **She is the city, shining with the glory of God!**
