Chapter 8: Bride
**The Bride’s Final Cry: ‘Come, Lord Jesus’** – Christ’s return is about **union, not fear**
_(Transitioning from Fear-Based Eschatology to the Longing for Union with Christ)_

#### **Introduction: The Cry of the Bride**

For many believers, the Second Coming of Christ is often framed as:  
❌ **A time of terror and global catastrophe.**  
❌ **A final judgment where many will be left behind.**  
❌ **An event to fear rather than something to long for.**

But Scripture paints **a different vision**:  
🔥 **The return of Christ is not about wrath—it is about the full union of the Bride and the Bridegroom.**  
🔥 **The end is not destruction—it is the beginning of the fullness of God’s Kingdom.**  
🔥 **The cry of the Church is not ‘rescue us!’ but ‘Come, Lord Jesus!’**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’ And let the one who hears say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **The Church must transition from fearing the end to eagerly anticipating Christ’s return.**

#### **Core Scripture: Revelation 21:2-3**

_"I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband… Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Return of Jesus Is About Union, Not Escape**

Before Christ, people expected:  
🔥 **A Messiah who would overthrow Rome and establish an earthly kingdom.**  
🔥 **A time of judgment where Israel’s enemies would be destroyed.**  
🔥 **A future age where the righteous would be rewarded and sinners cast out.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined the expectation**:  
🔥 **His return is not about political power—it is about full restoration.**  
🔥 **The Church is not waiting for a violent overthrow—it is preparing for a wedding.**  
🔥 **The focus is not escaping the world—it is God making His home with us.**

> _"Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven… and all the peoples of the earth will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."_ (Matthew 24:30)

🔥 **The return of Christ is not a threat—it is the fulfillment of the Bride’s deepest longing.**

This means:  
✅ **The Church is not hiding in fear—we are preparing in love.**  
✅ **We are not waiting for Jesus to take us away—we are preparing for His reign on earth.**  
✅ **His coming is not about condemnation—it is about consummation.**

> _"For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has made herself ready."_ (Revelation 19:7)

🔥 **The Church must transition from expecting destruction to preparing for divine union.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Bride Is Being Prepared**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **God’s presence was distant, revealed only through prophets and priests.**
- **The people waited for the Messiah to restore the nation of Israel.**
- **The focus was on earthly Jerusalem as the center of God’s rule.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Holy Spirit is already preparing the Bride.**  
✅ **The Messiah’s Kingdom is already advancing in the world.**  
✅ **The Church is the New Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God.**

Paul declared:

> _"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the Word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant Church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish."_ (Ephesians 5:25-27)

🔥 **Jesus is not coming for a weak, defeated Bride—He is coming for a glorious, prepared people!**

This means:  
✅ **We are not passively waiting—we are actively being transformed.**  
✅ **The Church is not an organization—it is the Bride being purified.**  
✅ **The Second Coming is not an escape—it is the completion of our redemption.**

> _"We know that when Christ appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."_ (1 John 3:2)

🔥 **The Church must transition from passivity to actively preparing for divine union.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Fear of Judgment to the Joy of Union**

Many believers still live with **a fear-based end-times mindset**:  
❌ **They are afraid of being left behind.**  
❌ **They expect only disaster rather than glory.**  
❌ **They view the Second Coming as a day of terror rather than a wedding day.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The return of Christ is not about fear—it is about fulfillment.**  
🔥 **The Bride does not tremble—she prepares herself with joy.**  
🔥 **Jesus is not coming to destroy—He is coming to fully establish His Kingdom.**

Paul wrote:

> _"For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:9-10)

🔥 **The return of Jesus is not about who will be punished—it is about the full revealing of His glory in the Bride.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From seeing the Second Coming as an escape to seeing it as union.**  
✅ **From fearing judgment to anticipating eternal communion.**  
✅ **From being passive to actively preparing in holiness and love.**

> _"The whole creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."_ (Romans 8:19)

🔥 **The world is not waiting for destruction—it is waiting for the full revealing of the sons and daughters of God.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Longs for Her Bridegroom**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to flee from the world but to be revealed in the fullness of glory with Christ.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you."_ (Isaiah 62:5)

John saw it:

> _"Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!"_ (Revelation 19:9)

Jesus declared it:

> _"Surely I am coming soon!" And the Bride responds, "Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!"_ (Revelation 22:20)

🔥 **The Church is not waiting in fear—we are standing in expectation.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about surviving the end—it is about entering into the fullness of God’s plan.**  
🔥 **We are not escaping the world—we are preparing to reign with Christ!**

The world will not end **with believers cowering in fear**—  
🔥 **It will end with the Bride standing in radiance, ready for her King.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not afraid—  
🔥 **She is longing for her Bridegroom!**
