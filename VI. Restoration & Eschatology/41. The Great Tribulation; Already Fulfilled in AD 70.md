Chapter 2: Tribulation
**The Great Tribulation: Already Fulfilled in AD 70** – Moving from **fear to fulfilled promise**
_(Transitioning from a Fear-Based End Times View to the Fulfilled Promises of the Kingdom)_

#### **Introduction: Moving from Fear to Fulfillment**

For centuries, many believers have been taught that **the Great Tribulation** is a future event—  
❌ **A time of worldwide suffering, destruction, and chaos.**  
❌ **A period when God pours out wrath upon the earth.**  
❌ **A sign that the world is about to end.**

But what if we have misunderstood?  
🔥 **What if the Great Tribulation already happened in the first century?**  
🔥 **What if it was about the destruction of Jerusalem, not the end of the world?**  
🔥 **What if we are not waiting for judgment—but walking in the fulfillment of God’s Kingdom now?**

> _"For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written."_ (Luke 21:22)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a fear-based eschatology to a Kingdom-centered vision of history.**

#### **Core Scripture: Matthew 24:34**

_"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Great Tribulation Was About Israel, Not the End of the World**

Before Christ, many expected:  
🔥 **A future messianic kingdom where Israel would rule over the nations.**  
🔥 **A dramatic end to oppression under Rome.**  
🔥 **A political Savior who would restore their national glory.**

But Jesus **redefined what was coming**:  
🔥 **The Kingdom was not about earthly power—it was about transformation.**  
🔥 **Jerusalem’s destruction was judgment for rejecting the Messiah.**  
🔥 **The Great Tribulation was the fulfillment of Old Testament warnings against Israel.**

> _"When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near."_ (Luke 21:20)

🔥 **Jesus was not talking about a global event thousands of years later—He was warning His generation of the coming Roman siege in AD 70.**

This means:  
✅ **The Great Tribulation was not about the end of the world—it was about the end of the Old Covenant age.**  
✅ **The destruction of the Temple was not a future sign—it was a past fulfillment.**  
✅ **We are not waiting for judgment—we are walking in the reality of Christ’s reign.**

> _"The Kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed… for the Kingdom of God is in your midst."_ (Luke 17:20-21)

🔥 **The Church must transition from expecting future wrath to understanding the victory we already walk in.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Old Age Has Ended—The Kingdom Has Come**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **God’s presence was in the Temple.**
- **Animal sacrifices were required for sin.**
- **Israel was under the Mosaic Law.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The Temple is no longer needed—Jesus is the true Temple.**  
✅ **Sacrifices have ended—Jesus is the final atonement.**  
✅ **The Old Covenant system was destroyed—Jesus established a new and better way.**

Paul declared:

> _"The present Jerusalem is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother."_ (Galatians 4:25-26)

🔥 **The destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 was not the end—it was the beginning of the Kingdom age!**

This means:  
✅ **The Church is not waiting for the Kingdom—it is already here and expanding.**  
✅ **The world is not destined for destruction—it is destined for restoration.**  
✅ **The last days were the last days of the Old Covenant, not the end of the world.**

> _"In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people."_ (Acts 2:17)

🔥 **The "last days" were already happening in the first century—the New Creation is already unfolding!**

The Church must transition **from expecting destruction to partnering with God in restoring creation.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Waiting for Judgment to Expanding the Kingdom**

Many believers still live in **a fearful view of the end times**:  
❌ **They expect global chaos instead of global restoration.**  
❌ **They fear the Antichrist instead of focusing on Christ’s victory.**  
❌ **They wait for an escape instead of fulfilling the Great Commission.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 was the end of the Old Covenant—not the end of history.**  
🔥 **The New Covenant is not about escaping the world—it is about transforming it.**  
🔥 **The focus is not on surviving tribulation—it is on expanding the Kingdom of God.**

Paul wrote:

> _"For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death."_ (1 Corinthians 15:25-26)

🔥 **Jesus is already reigning—our mission is to bring His Kingdom to earth!**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From fearing the future to embracing our role in God’s restoration plan.**  
✅ **From focusing on destruction to walking in the victory of Christ’s reign.**  
✅ **From waiting for an escape to fulfilling our calling as ambassadors of the Kingdom.**

> _"The knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

🔥 **The future is not one of despair—it is one of increasing glory!**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Kingdom Victory**

The final destiny of the Church is **not escaping earth—it is filling the earth with the glory of God.**

Isaiah saw it:

> _"Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end."_ (Isaiah 9:7)

Jesus prophesied it:

> _"The meek will inherit the earth."_ (Matthew 5:5)

Paul revealed it:

> _"Then comes the end, when He hands over the Kingdom to God the Father, after He has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power."_ (1 Corinthians 15:24)

🔥 **We are not just waiting for Christ’s return—we are partnering with Him to restore all things!**  
🔥 **We are not hiding in fear—we are advancing in Kingdom authority!**  
🔥 **We are not anticipating disaster—we are proclaiming victory!**

The world will not end with **a rapture into the clouds**—  
🔥 **It will end with a restored, redeemed, and glorified creation under Christ’s reign.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not trembling—  
🔥 **She is standing in the confidence of the already-victorious King!**
