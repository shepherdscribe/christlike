Chapter 5: Worship
**The Throne Room & Heavenly Worship** – Worship is about **oneness, not just music**
_(Transitioning from a Limited View of Worship to a Revelation of Heaven’s Eternal Praise)_

#### **Introduction: Worship as Heaven’s Reality**

For many believers, **worship is often seen as**:  
❌ **Just a time of singing before the sermon.**  
❌ **A personal experience rather than a cosmic reality.**  
❌ **A duty rather than an encounter with God.**

But Scripture paints a **different vision**:  
🔥 **Worship is not just something we do—it is the reality of heaven.**  
🔥 **The throne room is not a distant place—it is where we are spiritually seated with Christ.**  
🔥 **Worship is not about rituals—it is about beholding the glory of God.**

> _"Day and night they never stop saying: ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.’"_ (Revelation 4:8)

🔥 **The Church must transition from viewing worship as a moment in time to seeing it as our eternal posture before God.**

#### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 12:22-24**

_"But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Worship Is Not a Performance—It Is a Response to the Presence of God**

Before Christ, worship was often seen as:  
🔥 **Confined to the Temple and priestly rituals.**  
🔥 **Focused on animal sacrifices and offerings.**  
🔥 **A duty rather than a delight.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined worship**:  
🔥 **True worship is not about location—it is about Spirit and truth.**  
🔥 **True worship is not about ceremony—it is about communion.**  
🔥 **True worship is not about law—it is about love.**

> _"Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks."_ (John 4:23)

🔥 **Jesus removed the barriers—now all believers have access to worship before the throne of God.**

This means:  
✅ **Worship is not about effort—it is about intimacy.**  
✅ **We do not need to "invite" God to show up—He is already present.**  
✅ **We do not worship to receive something—we worship because He is worthy.**

> _"For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh."_ (Philippians 3:3)

🔥 **The Church must transition from striving in worship to abiding in the reality of God's presence.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Are Already Seated in the Throne Room**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place once a year.**
- **Worship required sacrifices and strict rituals.**
- **God’s presence was distant, behind a veil.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **The veil has been torn—now we boldly enter His presence (Hebrews 10:19).**  
✅ **Jesus is our High Priest, leading us in heavenly worship.**  
✅ **We are seated with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6).**

Paul declared:

> _"Since then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."_ (Colossians 3:1)

🔥 **Heavenly worship is not something we wait for—it is something we join in now.**

This means:  
✅ **Every time we worship, we are entering into the eternal song of heaven.**  
✅ **We do not worship to get closer to God—He has already drawn us near.**  
✅ **Worship is not about emotion—it is about revelation.**

> _"We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus."_ (Hebrews 10:19)

🔥 **The Church must transition from earthly worship to a heavenly perspective of worship.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Performance to Presence**

Many believers still live with **a mindset of limited worship**:  
❌ **They see worship as an event rather than a lifestyle.**  
❌ **They rely on emotions rather than on the revelation of Christ.**  
❌ **They view worship as something they do rather than who they are.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Worship is a response to seeing Jesus.**  
🔥 **True worship is Spirit-led, not performance-driven.**  
🔥 **The Church is not just a gathering—it is a temple of living stones.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship."_ (Romans 12:1)

🔥 **Worship is not an event—it is the offering of our whole lives to God.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From worship as an act to worship as a lifestyle.**  
✅ **From emotional highs to deep encounters with God.**  
✅ **From focusing on the song to focusing on the One we sing to.**

> _"The Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; He will lead them to springs of living water."_ (Revelation 7:17)

🔥 **Heavenly worship is not about us—it is about the Lamb who sits on the throne.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Perpetual Worship**

The final destiny of the Church is **not just singing in heaven—it is reigning with Christ in His presence.**

Isaiah saw it:

> _"And the whole earth is full of His glory."_ (Isaiah 6:3)

John saw it:

> _"Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: ‘To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, forever and ever!’"_ (Revelation 5:13)

Jesus promised it:

> _"The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth."_ (John 4:23)

🔥 **The Church is not waiting to worship in heaven—we are already joining in heaven’s song!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about waiting to see Jesus—we are already in His presence.**  
🔥 **We are not preparing for worship—we are living in it now.**

The world will not end **with believers gathering for the first time before God’s throne**—  
🔥 **It will end with every knee bowing and every tongue confessing that Jesus is Lord!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not waiting to worship—  
🔥 **She is already adoring her King!**
