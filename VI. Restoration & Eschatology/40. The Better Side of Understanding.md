Chapter 1: History
### **We Are Now on the Better Side of Understanding: Seeing God’s Kingdom Through History**

_(Transitioning from Partial Revelation to the Fullness of Christlike Understanding)_

---

### **Introduction: The Privilege of Living in This Time**

What if **we are more privileged than the Old Testament prophets and even the early Church?**

Many believers misunderstand **God’s unfolding plan** in three key ways:  
❌ **Some think the Old Testament saints fully understood God’s plan, but they only saw glimpses.**  
❌ **Others assume the New Testament Church instantly transitioned into the fullness of Christlikeness, when they were still leaving behind old ways.**  
❌ **Many fail to see that history itself reveals God's Kingdom taking over, making things clearer than ever before.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **The Old Testament was filled with shadows, not full revelation.**  
🔥 **The early Church was in transition, still struggling with Old Covenant mindsets.**  
🔥 **We now see, through history, how God’s Kingdom is advancing, changing societies and transforming human understanding.**

> _"Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."_ (Matthew 13:16-17)

🔥 **The Church must transition from fragmented understanding to recognizing that God’s Kingdom is an unstoppable force throughout history.**

### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 1:1-2**

_"In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom also He made the universe."_

🔥 **God’s revelation is progressive—He reveals more of His plan in each era.**

### **The Christ Filter: How Revelation Unfolded Over Time**

Before Christ, **people understood God’s will only in part**:  
🔥 **The Old Testament people knew God’s justice but did not fully grasp His mercy.**  
🔥 **They saw judgment but did not fully see grace.**  
🔥 **Even after Christ, the early Church was still transitioning from Old Covenant thinking.**

But when Jesus came, He **revealed the Father's full nature**:  
🔥 **He taught love over vengeance (Matthew 5:38-39).**  
🔥 **He revealed that mercy triumphs over judgment (James 2:13).**  
🔥 **He showed that God’s heart was always for redemption, not destruction (John 3:17).**

> _"These things God has revealed to us by His Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God."_ (1 Corinthians 2:10)

🔥 **We now see with greater clarity than any generation before us.**

This means:  
✅ **God’s plan was not fully known in the Old Testament—it was revealed progressively.**  
✅ **Even the early Church had to learn to transition from Old Covenant ways.**  
✅ **We now have the privilege of seeing how God’s Kingdom has changed societies throughout history.**

> _"Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the Kingdom of heaven is greater than he."_ (Matthew 11:11)

🔥 **We live in a time where we understand more than even John the Baptist did!**

### **New Covenant Reality: The Kingdom Expands Through History**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Slavery was normal—even regulated under Mosaic Law.**
- **War was a method of securing divine promises.**
- **Women had lesser rights and were seen as property in some societies.**
- **Vengeance and retribution were seen as justice.**

Even in the early Church:

- **Paul had to teach believers that in Christ, slaves and masters were equal (Philemon 1:15-16).**
- **Peter struggled to accept that Gentiles were included in God’s plan (Acts 10:14-15).**
- **The apostles had to address the mistreatment of women in churches (Galatians 3:28).**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Christians now recognize that slavery is evil, reflecting Christ’s value for human dignity.**  
✅ **War is no longer seen as a means of divine conquest—peace and reconciliation are the way of Christ.**  
✅ **Women and men are seen as equals in Christ, fulfilling God’s original intent (Genesis 1:27, Galatians 3:28).**  
✅ **The justice of God is no longer about retribution—it is about restoration and healing.**

Paul declared:

> _"He made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ."_ (Ephesians 1:9-10)

🔥 **We now see God’s plan with greater clarity than any generation before us.**

This means:  
✅ **The way we view morality has changed—not because God changed, but because we see Him more clearly through Christ.**  
✅ **Society has been shaped by Christ’s teachings, even when people do not realize it.**  
✅ **The Kingdom is advancing—not through war, but through transformation.**

> _"Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end."_ (Isaiah 9:7)

🔥 **The Church must transition from thinking God’s Kingdom is yet to come, to seeing it actively expanding in the earth.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Expectation to Participation**

Many believers still misunderstand history’s role in revealing God’s Kingdom:  
❌ **Some think the world is getting worse, missing how the Kingdom is advancing.**  
❌ **Others are still waiting for Christ’s rule in the future, missing how He reigns now.**  
❌ **Many do not recognize the privilege of living in a time where we see more than any past generation.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The Kingdom was already growing, even though they couldn’t see its full impact yet.**  
🔥 **God’s rule was spreading through love and transformation, not political power.**  
🔥 **We now see, through history, how Christ’s Kingdom is taking over the earth.**

Paul wrote:

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

🔥 **The Kingdom is advancing, and we are part of its expansion!**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From waiting for the Kingdom to recognizing that it is already expanding.**  
✅ **From focusing on the darkness to seeing how Christ’s light is overcoming it.**  
✅ **From longing for revival to living in the reality of Christ’s reign today.**

> _"He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet."_ (1 Corinthians 15:25)

🔥 **The Church is not losing—we are witnessing the victory of Christ unfolding through history!**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Sees the Kingdom Expanding**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to escape but to bring heaven to earth.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn."_ (Isaiah 60:3)

Jesus declared it:

> _"The Kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."_ (Matthew 13:33)

Paul revealed it:

> _"For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet."_ (1 Corinthians 15:25)

🔥 **The Church is not waiting for the Kingdom—it is expanding the Kingdom.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about escaping the world—it is about transforming it.**  
🔥 **We are not powerless—we are privileged to see history revealing God’s full plan.**

The world will not end **in defeat**—  
🔥 **It will end with Christ fully revealed as King over all!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **We are not waiting for the Kingdom—we are part of its fulfillment!**
