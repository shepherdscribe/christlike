Chapter 6: Glory
**The Sons of God & the Revealing of Glory** – Christlikeness is **our destiny, not just a goal**
_(Transitioning from a Servant Mentality to Sonship in the Kingdom)_

#### **Introduction: The Unveiling of God’s Sons**

Many believers live with **a limited understanding of their identity**, thinking:  
❌ **They are merely servants of God, working to please Him.**  
❌ **They are waiting to enter glory only after death.**  
❌ **They are powerless, just trying to survive in a broken world.**

But Scripture paints **a different picture**:  
🔥 **God is not just looking for obedient followers—He is revealing mature sons and daughters.**  
🔥 **Glory is not just for the afterlife—it is already being unveiled in us.**  
🔥 **The Church is not just enduring until Christ returns—we are actively displaying His Kingdom.**

> _"For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."_ (Romans 8:19)

🔥 **The Church must transition from seeing itself as servants to walking in the full authority of sonship.**

#### **Core Scripture: Romans 8:14-17**

_"For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God… The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Revealed Sonship, Not Just Servanthood**

Before Christ, people related to God through:  
🔥 **The Law, which created a servant-master relationship.**  
🔥 **A religious system where only priests had access to God’s presence.**  
🔥 **A mindset of striving for approval rather than living from acceptance.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined our identity**:  
🔥 **He did not come just as a teacher—He came as the Son.**  
🔥 **He did not introduce another law—He revealed the Father.**  
🔥 **He did not call us servants—He called us brothers and sisters.**

> _"I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends."_ (John 15:15)

🔥 **Jesus did not die just to forgive sins—He died to bring many sons to glory!**

This means:  
✅ **We are not just saved—we are adopted as sons and daughters.**  
✅ **We do not serve to earn God’s favor—we serve because we already have His love.**  
✅ **We are not just waiting for glory—we are being transformed into it.**

> _"And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into His image with ever-increasing glory."_ (2 Corinthians 3:18)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a slave mentality to walking confidently in sonship.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Are Co-Heirs with Christ**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **God was seen as distant, approached through rituals.**
- **Only a select few had direct access to His presence.**
- **People obeyed out of duty rather than relationship.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus has brought us into direct relationship with the Father.**  
✅ **We are seated with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6).**  
✅ **We are co-heirs, sharing in Christ’s inheritance.**

Paul declared:

> _"Because you are His sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, ‘Abba, Father.’ So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are His child, God has made you also an heir."_ (Galatians 4:6-7)

🔥 **God is not just preparing a place for us—He is preparing us for glory!**

This means:  
✅ **We are not waiting for adoption—we already belong to the Father.**  
✅ **We are not trying to earn our place—we are already heirs of the Kingdom.**  
✅ **We are not powerless—we carry the authority of Christ.**

> _"You did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, ‘Abba, Father!’"_ (Romans 8:15)

🔥 **The Church must transition from living like orphans to walking in the full rights of sonship.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Powerless Christianity to Manifesting the Sons of God**

Many believers still live with **a limited mindset**:  
❌ **They think they are just sinners saved by grace, rather than new creations.**  
❌ **They see themselves as powerless in a dark world.**  
❌ **They believe their transformation happens only after death, rather than in this life.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The resurrection of Jesus inaugurated a new humanity.**  
🔥 **The Holy Spirit empowers us to live as sons and daughters now.**  
🔥 **We are not just surviving until heaven—we are revealing heaven on earth.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man."_ (1 Corinthians 15:49)

🔥 **We are not just forgiven sinners—we are transformed sons and daughters, bearing Christ’s image.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From seeing Christianity as survival to embracing our role as Kingdom ambassadors.**  
✅ **From focusing on avoiding sin to manifesting the glory of God.**  
✅ **From waiting for transformation to walking in it now.**

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

🔥 **The world is not waiting for more religion—it is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Full Maturity**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to remain in spiritual infancy—it is to be fully revealed as sons and daughters of God.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you."_ (Isaiah 60:1)

John saw it:

> _"Beloved, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."_ (1 John 3:2)

Paul declared it:

> _"I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us."_ (Romans 8:18)

🔥 **The Church is not just waiting for the Second Coming—we are stepping into our full identity in Christ!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not just about escaping hell—it is about walking in divine sonship.**  
🔥 **We are not just called to serve—we are called to reign with Christ!**

The world will not end **with believers remaining weak and waiting**—  
🔥 **It will end with the fully revealed sons of God, shining in the image of Christ.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not uncertain—  
🔥 **She is standing in her full identity as a co-heir with Christ!**
