### **ShepherdPreach Sermon: Living in God’s Presence**

**Expository Preaching from Exodus 33**  
_(Transitioning from Seeking Moments to Walking in Continuous Communion)_

---

## **1. Introduction: The Tension Between Presence and Distance**

Exodus 33 captures a powerful moment in Israel’s history. They had sinned by worshiping the golden calf, and now God was saying He would send an angel to lead them, but **His presence would not go with them** (Exodus 33:3).

🔥 **Moses refused to accept this.** He understood that **nothing was more valuable than God’s presence.**

Today, many believers live as if they are satisfied with **blessings without presence**, as if God’s gifts are enough. But Moses shows us a different way—**a life that longs for God Himself, not just His provision.**

> _"If Your presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here."_ (Exodus 33:15)

🔥 **Are we desperate for His presence, or are we content with just His blessings?**

---

## **2. Scripture: Exodus 33:12-23**

This passage reveals **Moses’ conversation with God** after the people’s great sin. God tells Moses to take the Israelites to the Promised Land, but He will not go with them. Moses **pleads for God’s presence** to remain with them, and God responds with **grace and revelation.**

> **Key Verses:**  
> _"My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."_ (Exodus 33:14)  
> _"Show me Your glory."_ (Exodus 33:18)

🔥 **Moses wasn’t satisfied with partial blessings—he wanted full communion.**

## **3. Insights/Content: Learning from Moses' Desire for God’s Presence**

### **A. The Consequences of Sin (Exodus 33:1-3)**

- The Israelites had sinned with the golden calf (Exodus 32).
- God was willing to give them the Promised Land, but **not His presence**.
- Many today settle for **answered prayers without intimacy with God**—but Moses knew better.

🔥 **A land without God is not a blessing—it is a curse.**

### **B. Moses’ Plea: Presence Over Promises (Exodus 33:12-16)**

Moses pleads for God to remain with them. He understands:  
✅ **God’s presence is what sets His people apart** (v. 16).  
✅ **Success without presence is meaningless.**  
✅ **God’s presence is the only guarantee of true rest (v. 14).**

🔥 **What are we seeking—His gifts, or Him?**

### **C. God’s Response: Personal Presence and Revelation (Exodus 33:17-23)**

- God assures Moses: **“I will do the very thing you have asked”** (v. 17).
- Moses asks for more: **“Show me Your glory”** (v. 18).
- God responds by revealing **His goodness, mercy, and name** (v. 19).

🔥 **God’s presence is not just power—it is His character revealed to us.**

## **4. Glorious Future: The Fulfillment of God’s Presence in Christ**

Moses longed for what we now have **in Christ**:  
✅ **Moses saw God’s back—we have Christ, the full revelation of God (John 1:14, Colossians 1:15).**  
✅ **Moses sought presence—we are now the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16).**  
✅ **Moses desired closeness—we are now seated with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6).**

🔥 **The presence Moses fought for is now our reality in Jesus.**

In eternity, this will be fully realized:

> _"Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them."_ (Revelation 21:3)

🔥 **We will no longer seek Him—we will dwell with Him forever.**

## **5. Challenge: Are We Desperate for God’s Presence?**

Moses’ heart cries out for something **we often take for granted**.

🔥 **Do we value His presence more than His blessings?**  
🔥 **Are we cultivating a life of intimacy, or do we only turn to Him in need?**  
🔥 **Are we truly satisfied in Him, or do we still chase after lesser things?**

### **Practical Steps to Living in His Presence:**

✅ **Daily surrender:** Start each day acknowledging Him (Proverbs 3:5-6).  
✅ **Unceasing communion:** Learn to walk with Him moment by moment (1 Thessalonians 5:17).  
✅ **Deepen intimacy:** Seek not just knowledge about Him, but His heart (Psalm 27:4).  
✅ **Live consecrated:** Remove distractions that dull your hunger for His presence (Hebrews 12:1-2).

🔥 **We are invited to live in the very presence Moses pleaded for. Will we say yes?**

## **6. Altar Call: A Call to Return to God’s Presence**

Today, God is inviting us to **return to deep communion with Him.**

👉 If you have been living in **spiritual distance**, come and return to His presence.  
👉 If you have been **content with blessings instead of intimacy**, cry out for Him like Moses did.  
👉 If you desire a **deeper revelation of His glory**, seek Him now—He is near.

🔥 **Come forward and make Moses’ prayer your own: "If Your presence does not go with me, I will not go."**

> _"Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you."_ (James 4:8)

🔥 **God’s presence is not something we visit—it is the home we were created for.**

## **7. Closing Prayer: A Cry for His Presence**

**Heavenly Father,**  
We come before You today, like Moses, crying out for Your presence. We do not want to go another day without You. Lord, we thank You for Your many blessings, but more than anything, we desire You.

Forgive us for the times we have chased after what You can give instead of simply wanting to be with You. Teach us to walk in Your presence daily, not just on Sundays, not just in special moments, but in every breath, every decision, and every season of our lives.

Holy Spirit, awaken our hearts to the reality that You are already here. Let us hunger and thirst for You. Let us live with the awareness that we are never alone, that we are never abandoned, and that we are always in the presence of the Living God.

Father, let our lives be a dwelling place for You. Teach us to live and move in You, to seek Your face continually, and to never settle for anything less than **deep, unbroken communion with You.**

We declare today: **"If Your presence does not go with us, we will not go."** We surrender to You completely, longing not just for Your power, but for Your heart.

Come, Lord. Fill us with Yourself.  
In Jesus’ mighty name, we pray. **Amen.**

🔥 **Now, let’s worship—not to invite God in, but to awaken our hearts to the reality that He is already here!**
