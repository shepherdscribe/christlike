### **The Story of Mountains and Valleys: From Eden to the Final Restoration**

The Bible tells a grand story where mountains and valleys symbolize God’s presence, His covenant with His people, and His ultimate plan to restore all things. It begins in Eden, moves through Israel’s history, finds its fulfillment in Jesus, and culminates in the restoration of the world.

## **1. Eden: The First Mountain of God**

In the beginning, the world was a temple, and **Eden was its holy mountain.**

- Eden was not just a garden but a **high place where God walked with humanity** (Ezekiel 28:13-14).
- Adam and Eve lived in **perfect communion with God,** much like how mountains later became places of divine encounters.
- But sin entered, and they were **cast down from this mountain, exiled from God's presence** (Genesis 3:23-24).

Thus began humanity’s **search for the mountain of God**—a place where we could dwell with Him once again.

## **2. Israel’s Journey: Victory on the Mountains, Yet God is Also in the Valleys**

After Eden, mountains became places of **divine encounters**, but God also proved that He is not just the God of mountains—**He is the God of the valleys too.**

- **Mount Moriah (Genesis 22:2-14)** – God provided a **substitute sacrifice** for Abraham, foreshadowing Jesus.
- **Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-20)** – God gave the **Law and the Covenant** to Moses, calling Israel to be His people.
- **Mount Zion (Psalm 48:1-2)** – David established **God’s kingdom** here, and Solomon built the **Temple**, where God’s presence dwelled.

Yet, despite these mountain experiences, Israel often found itself **in the valleys—both physically and spiritually**.

### **The Battle in the Valley: God is Not Limited to the Mountains**

One of the most powerful demonstrations of God's presence **beyond the mountains** happens in **1 Kings 20**, during a war between Israel and Aram (Syria).

- The **Aramean army believed that Israel’s God was only a God of the mountains**, because Israel had won battles in the high places.
- They reasoned: **“Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were stronger than we are. But if we fight them on the plains (valleys), surely we will be stronger than they are.”** (1 Kings 20:23).
- But **God responded**, declaring: **“Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the Lord.”** (1 Kings 20:28).
- **Despite being outnumbered**, Israel **defeated the Arameans in the valley**, proving that God is not limited by location—**He is Lord over all places.**

This story foreshadowed a greater truth: **God would not remain confined to a single mountain (Sinai, Zion, or the Temple). He would dwell with His people everywhere.**

## **3. Jesus: The Mountain of God Comes Down to Us**

For centuries, people thought they had to **go to the mountain to meet God**—whether to Sinai for the Law or to Zion for the Temple. But in Jesus, **God came down the mountain to be with us.**

- **The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)** – Jesus taught a new law of the heart, not just external commandments.
- **The Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-8)** – Jesus' divine glory was revealed on a mountain, showing that **He is the true meeting place between God and man.**
- **The Mount of Olives and Golgotha** – Jesus prayed in the valley before going to **the hill of Calvary**, where He conquered sin through His death and resurrection.

This is why **Jesus told the Samaritan woman**:  
**"A time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... true worshipers will worship in spirit and in truth."** (John 4:21-23)

The age of **mountain-based worship was over**. The Kingdom of God was no longer a place—it was **a people.**

## **4. The Final Mountain: Eden Restored to All the Earth**

Now, we live between **two mountains**:

1. The **Mountain of Christ**, where the New Covenant began.
2. The **Final Mountain of God**, where all things will be restored.

- The **New Covenant** means **God is with us everywhere**—in the mountains **and** in the valleys.
- One day, the **New Jerusalem** will descend from heaven (Revelation 21:2).
- The whole earth will be **filled with His presence**, just like Eden once was.

**“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.”** (Habakkuk 2:14)

---

### **Conclusion: The God of Mountains and Valleys**

- Humanity **fell from the mountain of Eden**, but God still met us **on mountains** throughout history.
- He proved that **He is also the God of valleys** by giving Israel victory against Aram.
- In Jesus, **God came down to us**, so that we no longer have to **climb the mountain to find Him**.
- Now, we await the final restoration—when **all the earth will become Eden again**, and God will dwell with His people forever.

**Until then, we walk in faith—knowing that whether we are on the mountain or in the valley, God is always with us.**

### **Sermon: The God of Mountains and Valleys – From Eden to the New Creation**

#### **Introduction**

Church, today we embark on a journey through Scripture, tracing a theme that runs from Genesis to Revelation—the significance of mountains and valleys in our walk with God.

Many of us have had **mountaintop experiences**—moments when we felt closest to God, when His presence was undeniable. But then, there are **valley moments**—times of struggle, discouragement, and doubt.

What if I told you that God is not just **the God of the mountains** but also **the God of the valleys**? That the whole story of Scripture is not about us climbing to God, but about **God coming down to us**?

Let’s journey through this together, from **Eden’s holy mountain** to **the final restoration**, and see how Jesus changes everything.

---

### **I. The First Mountain: Eden, Where God Walked with Us**

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and He placed humanity in a **garden that was also a mountain**.

Ezekiel 28:13-14 describes Eden as “the holy mountain of God.” It was **the place where heaven and earth were one**, where God walked with Adam and Eve in perfect fellowship.

But what happened? **Sin entered**, and humanity was **cast down from that mountain**, separated from God’s presence (Genesis 3:23-24).

Ever since that moment, people have been **trying to climb back up**—trying to **earn their way back to God** through religion, sacrifices, and laws. But no matter how high they climbed, **they could never reach Him.**

---

### **II. The Journey of Faith: God Calls His People to the Mountain**

Throughout the Old Testament, mountains became **places of divine encounter**, where God revealed Himself to His people.

1. **Mount Ararat** – After the flood, Noah’s ark **rested on a mountain**, symbolizing a new beginning (Genesis 8:4).
2. **Mount Moriah** – Abraham was tested to **sacrifice Isaac**, but God provided a substitute (Genesis 22:2-14).
3. **Mount Sinai** – God gave **Moses the Law and the Covenant**, establishing a way for Israel to relate to Him (Exodus 19-20).
4. **Mount Zion** – David established **God’s kingdom**, and Solomon built **the Temple**, where God’s presence dwelled (Psalm 48:1-2).

But here’s the problem: **Every mountain still pointed to one thing—human separation from God.**

Even in the Temple on Mount Zion, a **thick curtain** separated God’s presence from the people. The message was clear: **We are still not back in Eden.**

### **III. The War in the Valley: God is Not Limited to the Mountains**

Now, many believed that God’s power was **only found on the mountains**. That as long as they were in the right place, they would be victorious.

But in **1 Kings 20**, we find an incredible story.

- Israel’s enemy, the Arameans, lost a battle on the hills and reasoned:  
    **“Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were stronger than we are. But if we fight them in the valleys, surely we will be stronger than they are.”** (1 Kings 20:23)
- But God **rebuked their thinking** and declared:  
    **“Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the Lord.”** (1 Kings 20:28)
- And **God gave Israel victory in the valley**, proving that **His power is not confined to high places**.

What does this mean for us today?

- Some of us are waiting to “get back to the mountain” before we believe God can move.
- We think God only works in **church services, spiritual highs, or revival moments.**
- But God is **just as present in the valleys of our struggles, disappointments, and suffering**.

**He is the God of the mountains and the valleys!**

### **IV. The Turning Point: The Mountain Comes Down to Us**

For centuries, people tried to **climb to God**, but then, everything changed.

**Instead of us going to the mountain… the mountain came to us.**

- **Jesus came down from heaven** to dwell among us (John 1:14).
- He did not call us to climb Sinai again; instead, He gave **a new law of grace** in the **Sermon on the Mount** (Matthew 5-7).
- He revealed His glory on the **Mount of Transfiguration**, showing that **He is now the meeting place between God and man** (Matthew 17:1-8).
- Then, on **a hill outside Jerusalem**, on **Mount Calvary**, Jesus died for our sins.

At the moment of His death, **the temple curtain tore in two** (Matthew 27:51). Why? Because **the separation was over!**

Jesus did what no mountain could do: **He made a way for God to dwell with us forever.**

This is why **Jesus told the Samaritan woman**:

**“A time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... true worshipers will worship in spirit and in truth.”** (John 4:21-23)

Worship was no longer tied to **a physical place**. **God’s presence was now with us everywhere!**

### **V. The Final Mountain: When All Earth Becomes Eden Again**

Now, we are living **between two mountains**:

1. The **Mountain of Christ**, where the New Covenant began.
2. The **Final Mountain of God**, where all things will be restored.

**What is the final mountain?**

Revelation 21 describes the **New Jerusalem coming down from heaven**, and Revelation 22 speaks of **a river flowing through it, just like in Eden.**

This is the final picture:

- The **whole earth** will become God’s dwelling place.
- Heaven and earth will be one.
- Eden will be restored.
- And we will live in **perfect fellowship with Him forever**.

**“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.”** (Habakkuk 2:14)

### **VI. Conclusion: Living in the Valley Until the Mountain Comes**

Until that day, we live in a world of **mountains and valleys**.

- Some of us are on the mountain, experiencing God’s **joy, strength, and presence**.
- Some of us are in the valley, **struggling with trials, doubts, and hardships**.

But wherever you are today, **God is with you.**

- He is **not just the God of your spiritual highs**, but **also of your lowest moments**.
- He **walked with Adam in Eden**, met Moses **on Sinai**, spoke to Elijah **in a still small voice**, and won battles **in the valley**.
- And now, **He walks with you through every mountain and valley of life.**

So church, do not fear the valley. Do not wait for the next mountaintop experience to seek God. He is here, **now**.

And one day, when all things are restored, **the whole earth will become His mountain again.**

**Until then, we worship Him everywhere, because He is the God of the mountains and the valleys!**

**Amen.**
