**Paul’s Revelation of the Mystery** – The Old Covenant pointed forward, but **Christ is the reality** (Colossians 1:27)
_(Transitioning from Shadows of the Old Covenant to the Fullness of Christ in the New Creation)_

#### **Introduction: The Mystery Hidden for Ages**

Throughout history, God revealed Himself in **shadows and glimpses**—through prophets, laws, and covenants.

- **Adam saw a promise** of a coming Redeemer (Genesis 3:15).
- **Abraham received a covenant**, but not the fullness (Genesis 12:2-3).
- **Moses was given the Law**, but it was only a shadow of something greater (Hebrews 10:1).
- **David saw glimpses of a greater Kingdom**, but not its reality (Psalm 110:1).

The Old Testament saints **longed to understand** what God was planning. The prophets saw fragments, but **they did not yet see the full picture**.

But then, something radical happened.  
The mystery that had been hidden for **ages and generations** was suddenly **revealed**.

And Paul was chosen to proclaim it.

> _"Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you, that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation… which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed."_ (Ephesians 3:2-5)

The **entire course of history** had changed.  
The **shadows were gone**.  
The **substance had come**.

And the mystery?  
**Christ in you, the hope of glory.**

#### **Core Scripture: Colossians 1:26-27**

_"The mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people. To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Mystery Was Not a Plan—It Was a Person**

Before Jesus, the people of God **were still in partial revelation**. They had **the Law, the prophets, the promises**, but they did not yet have **the fullness of God dwelling in them**.

But when Christ came, He revealed something **far greater than just salvation from sin**.

He revealed:  
✅ **That the New Covenant was not just forgiveness—it was transformation.**  
✅ **That the Kingdom was not just future—it was now expanding.**  
✅ **That the dwelling place of God was no longer in a temple—it was in His people.**

The **mystery was not just that Jesus came to die.**  
The **mystery was that He came to live inside His people.**

The Old Covenant was about **keeping laws, obeying rules, and waiting for a future promise**.  
The New Covenant is about **union with Christ, walking in His fullness, and living as the New Creation now.**

This is why Paul did not just preach about a **Messiah who forgives sins**.  
He preached about a **King who rules in the hearts of His people and transforms the world through them**.

> _"I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

Paul did not preach **religion**—he preached **a new humanity in Christ.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Church is the Fullness of Christ**

Under the Old Covenant, God’s presence dwelled in the **temple, behind a veil**. Only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year.

But under the New Covenant, something **radical** happened.

- The veil was **torn** (Matthew 27:51).
- The temple was **no longer necessary** (John 4:23).
- The Spirit of God was **poured out upon all believers** (Acts 2:17).

Now, the **body of Christ—His people—is the dwelling place of God.**

> _"And God placed all things under His feet and appointed Him to be head over everything for the Church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way."_ (Ephesians 1:22-23)

This means:  
✅ **You are not just saved—you are indwelt by the fullness of Christ.**  
✅ **You are not just forgiven—you are a new creation.**  
✅ **You are not just waiting for heaven—you are bringing heaven to earth now.**

Paul’s revelation was not about **getting people to heaven**—it was about **revealing Christ’s fullness in His people on earth.**

The Old Testament prophets **longed to see what we now walk in**.  
The mystery hidden for generations **is now revealed in us.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Law-Minded Religion to Christ-Formed Maturity**

Many believers still live **as if they are under the Old Covenant**, thinking:

- **They are distant from God**—even though He lives inside them.
- **They must follow religious laws**—even though they are under grace.
- **They are waiting for the Kingdom to come**—even though it is already advancing.

But Paul taught the Church:

- **You are not just sinners saved by grace—you are sons and daughters of God.**
- **You are not just waiting for Christ’s return—you are reigning with Him now.**
- **You are not just attending church—you are the very Body of Christ, filled with His power.**

This is the transition from:  
✅ **Law to Spirit** (Galatians 5:18)  
✅ **Temple-based worship to being the temple** (1 Corinthians 3:16)  
✅ **Hoping for revival to living in it daily** (Romans 8:11)

> _"God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself."_ (Colossians 1:19-20)

This is why Paul did not just preach **a new doctrine**—he preached **a new creation**.

And now, the Church must awaken to this reality:

- We are **not just servants—we are sons and daughters.**
- We are **not just believers—we are the body of Christ on earth.**
- We are **not just waiting for His presence—we are carrying His presence.**

We are **not waiting to receive the mystery**—we are living in its fulfillment.

> _"Christ in you, the hope of glory."_

#### **Glorious Future: The Manifestation of the Sons of God**

Paul saw a time when **the people of God would fully walk in this revelation**.

> _"For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."_ (Romans 8:19)

This is not just about a **future event**.  
This is about **a present reality unfolding more and more each day**.

The future of the Church is **not weakness—it is fullness**.  
The future of the world is **not destruction—it is the increasing revelation of Christ’s Kingdom.**

Paul saw the end goal:

> _"Until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."_ (Ephesians 4:13)

The final revelation will not just be **Christ returning**.  
It will be **a mature Church, fully walking in His image**.

The mystery has been revealed.  
And now, **it must be lived.**

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)
