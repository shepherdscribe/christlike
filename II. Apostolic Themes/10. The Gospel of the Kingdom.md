**The Gospel of the Kingdom** – Jesus didn’t preach escaping earth—He preached **restoration**
_(Transitioning from a Gospel of Escape to a Gospel of Restoration)_

#### **Introduction: The Gospel We Were Not Told**

For many, the word "Gospel" has been reduced to a **personal salvation message**—a way to escape hell and enter heaven. The Gospel is preached as:

- **“Jesus died for your sins so you can go to heaven when you die.”**
- **“Repent so you don’t face God’s wrath.”**
- **“Say the sinner’s prayer, and you’ll be saved.”**

While these statements hold **partial truths**, they **fail to capture the fullness of what Jesus actually preached.**

Jesus did not come preaching **the Gospel of salvation alone**.  
Jesus came preaching **the Gospel of the Kingdom.**

And that changes everything.

#### **Core Scripture: Mark 1:14-15**

_"After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 'The time is fulfilled,' He said. 'The Kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the Gospel!'"_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Kingdom Was the Gospel**

When Jesus spoke of the Gospel, He was not merely offering a **ticket to heaven**—He was announcing **the arrival of the Kingdom of God on earth.**

> _"I must proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."_ (Luke 4:43)

Jesus’ mission was **not just to get people to heaven**. It was to **bring heaven to earth**.

This is why His message **did not start with the cross**, but with:

- **“The Kingdom of God is at hand.”**
- **“The Kingdom of heaven is like…”** _(repeated in nearly every parable)_
- **“Your Kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”**

The Gospel is not simply about **rescue from sin**—it is about **restoration of the world under Christ’s reign.**

The Jews expected a **Messianic King who would overthrow Rome**.  
Instead, they received **a King who overthrew sin, darkness, and death itself.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Kingdom Has Already Begun**

For centuries, many have believed that the Kingdom of God is **a future event**—something that will come when Jesus returns.

But Jesus made it clear:

> _"The Kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the Kingdom of God is within you."_ (Luke 17:20-21)

> _"The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand!"_ (Mark 1:15)

This means:  
✅ **The Kingdom is not waiting to be established—it has already begun.**  
✅ **We are not waiting to enter the Kingdom—it is already growing through us.**  
✅ **Jesus is not coming to build a Kingdom—He is returning to consummate the one already expanding.**

The Gospel of the Kingdom is not about **escaping earth**—it is about **renewing it**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Escape to Restoration**

Many believers still see **the world as a lost cause**, waiting for Jesus to return and fix everything.

But the early Church was learning something new:

- They were not called to **wait** for the Kingdom—they were called to **advance** it.
- They were not called to **escape the world**—they were called to **restore it**.
- They were not called to **sit in fear**—they were called to **walk in dominion.**

This is the difference between **religion** and **Kingdom reality**:

- **Religion says, “Hold on until Jesus comes.”**
- **The Kingdom says, “Transform the world until Jesus returns.”**
- **Religion says, “The earth is getting worse.”**
- **The Kingdom says, “The knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.”** (Habakkuk 2:14)

Jesus did not tell His disciples, **“Go and build churches.”**  
He told them, **“Go and make disciples of all nations.”** (Matthew 28:19)

The Gospel is not just about saving individuals—it is about **transforming entire nations under the reign of Christ.**

> _"Of the increase of His government and peace, there will be no end."_ (Isaiah 9:7)

The Church was never meant to **retreat and wait for rescue**—it was meant to **bring the reality of heaven into every corner of the earth.**

#### **Glorious Future: The Kingdom That Fills the Earth**

The future of the world is **not destruction—it is restoration**.

Daniel saw it:

> _"The God of heaven will set up a Kingdom that will never be destroyed… It will crush all other kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever."_ (Daniel 2:44)

John saw it:

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

This means:

- **Jesus is already reigning—He is not waiting for a future throne.**
- **The Kingdom is not diminishing—it is increasing.**
- **The end of the story is not destruction—it is renewal and Christ’s full reign over all things.**

Jesus did not come to take a few souls to heaven.  
He came to **restore all things**—until the entire world is under His rule.

And one day, when heaven and earth are made new, the Kingdom will no longer be **hidden within us**.

It will be **fully visible to all creation.**
