**The Apostolic Foundation** – Built on **Christ, not just tradition** (Ephesians 2:20)
_(Transitioning from Religious Tradition to Christ-Centered Apostolic Mission)_

#### **Introduction: The Foundation That Could Not Be Shaken**

For centuries, the people of God had built their faith on **Moses, the Law, and the Temple**. These were their pillars—their foundation. The Law was their covenant. The Temple was their dwelling place with God. Their nation was set apart, governed by priests and kings who carried divine authority.

But when Jesus came, **He disrupted everything**.

He did not reinforce **the old foundation**—He **revealed a new one**.

The Pharisees clung to the Law, but Jesus declared, **“I am the fulfillment of the Law.”**  
The people revered the Temple, but Jesus said, **“Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”**  
The religious leaders held to their traditions, but Jesus rebuked them, saying, **“You nullify the Word of God for the sake of your tradition.”**

And when Jesus ascended, He did not leave behind **a new law, a new temple, or a new religious system**.

He left behind **a people—built on a new foundation.**

#### **Core Scripture: Ephesians 2:19-20**

_"You are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Foundation is a Person, Not a System**

Under the Old Covenant, the foundation of faith was **the Law of Moses**. Everything revolved around rules, rituals, and regulations. Righteousness was about **obedience to commands, sacrifices for sin, and separation from impurity**.

But Jesus came, and **He was the foundation they had never seen before**.

- He did not **point to a new law**—He **pointed to Himself**.
- He did not **restore an earthly kingdom**—He **brought the Kingdom of Heaven**.
- He did not **build a new temple of stone**—He **made His people the temple of God**.

This is why **the apostles were not just messengers**—they were the foundation of something **entirely new**.

> _"And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it."_ (Matthew 16:18)

But notice something: Jesus did not say, **"I will build a new religion."**  
He did not say, **"I will build a new law."**

He said, **"I will build My church."**

The **ekklesia**, the gathering of called-out ones—**not an institution, but a movement.**

And what is this movement built on?

> _"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."_ (1 Corinthians 3:11)

The apostles were the **first stones**, but Christ was the cornerstone.

The foundation was not **doctrine**—it was **a Person**.  
The foundation was not **a new law**—it was **grace and truth in Jesus**.  
The foundation was not **a temple**—it was **a people united in Him**.

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Apostolic Mission is Christ, Not Control**

In the Old Covenant, religious authority was held by **priests, elders, and kings**. The people depended on them for **guidance, interpretation, and mediation** between them and God.

But in the New Covenant, the **apostolic foundation** was not about control—it was about **empowerment**.

- The **Pharisees controlled the people** through fear and legalism.
- The **apostles released the people** into sonship and freedom.
- The **Pharisees hoarded knowledge**—the apostles **equipped disciples to walk in revelation**.

This is the shift from **Old Covenant priesthood to New Covenant apostolic mission**:  
✅ **The Old Covenant built walls; the New Covenant sends messengers.**  
✅ **The Old Covenant had priests as mediators; the New Covenant makes all believers a royal priesthood.**  
✅ **The Old Covenant required a temple; the New Covenant makes every believer the dwelling place of God.**

The apostles did not create **a new system of religious power**—they laid a foundation that **equipped every believer to carry the presence and power of Jesus**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Institutional Religion to Apostolic Movement**

Many believers still think of **church as an institution**—something to attend, something ruled by **hierarchy and tradition**.

But the early Church understood something radical:

- They were not called to **build a new religious empire**—they were called to **expand the Kingdom of God**.
- They were not called to **gather in temples**—they **became the temple**.
- They were not called to **replace the Pharisees**—they were called to **walk in Christlikeness**.

This is the apostolic shift the early Church had to make:

- **From the Law to the Spirit** (Galatians 5:18)
- **From temple-based worship to Spirit-filled gatherings** (John 4:23)
- **From legalistic control to Spirit-empowered freedom** (2 Corinthians 3:17)

But even today, some still struggle to make this transition.  
They cling to religious systems that **God has already torn down**.

- They believe the church is **a building, rather than a people**.
- They believe apostles and prophets **are gatekeepers, rather than foundation-layers**.
- They believe faith is about **submission to men, rather than union with Christ**.

But the true apostolic foundation **is not control**—it is **equipping every believer to walk in full sonship and authority.**

> _"You are no longer slaves, but God’s children. And since you are His children, He has made you heirs."_ (Galatians 4:7)

This is the true legacy of the apostles.  
They did not leave behind **a religious empire**.  
They left behind **a people filled with the Spirit, moving in power, and walking in the reality of the Kingdom.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Fully Apostolic Church**

There is a day coming when the Church will be **fully mature, fully apostolic, fully Christlike**.

Paul saw this:

> _"So Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip His people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up… until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."_ (Ephesians 4:11-13)

The end goal is not **a religious system**—it is **a people fully reflecting Christ**.

The end of the story is not **a church bound by tradition**—it is **a Bride walking in the fullness of Jesus.**

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

The apostolic foundation is **not a position—it is a mission**.

And that mission is **the full manifestation of Christ in His people.**
