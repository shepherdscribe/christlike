**Born Again: A New Creation** – Christianity isn’t about behavior modification, but **becoming new**
_(Transitioning from Sin-Consciousness to Christ-Consciousness & Kingdom Identity)_

#### **Introduction: More Than Just Forgiven**

For many believers, salvation is seen as simply **the forgiveness of sins**—a way to escape judgment and secure a place in heaven.

They say things like:

- **"I’m just a sinner saved by grace."**
- **"I can’t help but sin—I’m only human."**
- **"One day in heaven, I’ll finally be free from my struggles."**

But **Paul preached something far greater** than just being forgiven. He preached that we have been **completely made new**.

Salvation is not just about having our **sins removed**—it is about **becoming a new kind of human.**

Jesus did not come **just to change our status** before God.  
He came **to change our very nature.**

> _"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!"_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

This is the mystery of the Gospel—**you are not just redeemed, you are reborn.**

#### **Core Scripture: Galatians 2:20**

_"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."_

#### **The Christ Filter: A New Humanity in Him**

Before Jesus, humanity was bound in **Adam’s nature**—fallen, enslaved to sin, disconnected from God.

But Jesus came, and **He was not just another prophet**. He was **the first of a new creation**—the **Last Adam** who birthed an entirely new kind of humanity.

> _"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."_ (1 Corinthians 15:22)

The first Adam **brought death**.  
The Last Adam **brought resurrection life**.

This is why Jesus did not just preach **repentance from sin**—He preached **entrance into a new life**.

> _"You must be born again."_ (John 3:7)

This means:  
✅ **Christianity is not just about getting better—it’s about becoming completely new.**  
✅ **The old self is not being improved—it has been crucified.**  
✅ **You are not just a forgiven sinner—you are a new creation in Christ.**

The Cross was **not just about canceling sin**—it was about **killing the old man and raising a new one.**

The resurrection was **not just an event in history**—it was the beginning of a new humanity, a new Kingdom, a new world order.

> _"For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation."_ (Galatians 6:15)

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Live in Christ, Not in Adam**

Many believers still live **as if they are in Adam**, believing:

- **They are always fighting their old nature.**
- **They are still bound to sin.**
- **They are distant from God.**

But Paul declared **something radical**:

> _"We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin."_ (Romans 6:6)

The old self is **dead**.  
The new self is **alive in Christ**.

This means:  
✅ **You are not fighting to become holy—you already are holy in Him.**  
✅ **You are not trying to overcome sin—you are already dead to sin.**  
✅ **You are not waiting to be free—you are already free in Christ.**

Under the Old Covenant, people were **sin-conscious**, always trying to atone, always aware of their failures.

But in the New Covenant, we are **Christ-conscious**, living in the reality of His righteousness.

> _"For by one sacrifice He has made perfect forever those who are being made holy."_ (Hebrews 10:14)

Your righteousness is **not achieved**—it is **received**.  
Your holiness is **not earned**—it is **your new nature in Christ**.

You are **not waiting to become a new creation**—you already are.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Defeated Living to Victorious Identity**

Many in the Church still live **as if they are trapped in their old selves**, saying:

- **"I’m trying to be a good Christian."**
- **"I hope God still loves me when I fail."**
- **"I don’t feel like a new creation, so maybe I’m not."**

But feelings **do not determine truth**.

The early Church had to transition:  
✅ **From striving for righteousness to walking in it.**  
✅ **From focusing on sin to focusing on Christ.**  
✅ **From hoping for transformation to living in it.**

The truth is:

- **You are not trying to be holy—you are already set apart in Christ.**
- **You are not trying to be close to God—you are already one with Him.**
- **You are not waiting for breakthrough—you are walking in it daily.**

This is why Paul told believers:

> _"Put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."_ (Ephesians 4:24)

You are **not your past**.  
You are **not your failures**.  
You are **not your old self trying to improve**.

You are **a new creation, seated with Christ, reigning in His life.**

#### **Glorious Future: The Revealing of the Sons of God**

Paul saw that **the world itself is waiting** for the Church to awaken to this reality.

> _"For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."_ (Romans 8:19)

This is not about a **future event**—it is about a present revelation.

- **The world does not need more religious people—it needs Kingdom sons and daughters.**
- **The world does not need more people bound in legalism—it needs those walking in resurrection power.**
- **The world does not need another revival event—it needs believers who live as Christ in the earth.**

This is why Jesus did not just say, **"You will be the light of the world."**  
He said, **"You ARE the light of the world."** (Matthew 5:14)

The new creation is **already advancing.**  
The Kingdom is **already increasing.**  
And the Church is **already seated in heavenly places.**

> _"And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus."_ (Ephesians 2:6)

We are **not waiting to be glorified**—we are walking in **the hope of glory now**.

And as we awaken to this reality, the world will no longer see a **weak, struggling Church**.

The world will see the **manifestation of the sons of God**—walking in His image, filled with His Spirit, and reigning in His life.

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)
