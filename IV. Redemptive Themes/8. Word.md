Jesus as God’s Word: The Living Revelation Beyond Scriptures
_(From a Book-Centered Faith to a Christ-Centered Faith)_

---

### **Introduction: The Word of God—A Person, Not Just a Text**

Many believers assume that **the "Word of God" simply refers to the Bible**.  
❌ **Some treat the Bible as if it is God Himself rather than a witness to Christ.**  
❌ **Others misuse Scripture by weaponizing verses without understanding Jesus’ heart.**  
❌ **Many unconsciously filter Jesus through the lens of the Law rather than seeing the Law through Jesus.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **The Word of God is not first and foremost a book—it is a Person.**  
🔥 **The Bible is a witness to Christ, not a substitute for Him.**  
🔥 **Jesus is the full and final revelation of God.**

> _"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."_ (John 1:1)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a text-centered faith to a Christ-centered revelation.**

### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 1:1-3**

_"In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom also He made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being."_

🔥 **Jesus is not just another messenger—He is the message itself.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Is the Ultimate Word of God**

Before Christ, people viewed God’s word in different ways:  
🔥 **The Jews saw the Law (Torah) as God’s ultimate revelation.**  
🔥 **The prophets brought additional words from God, pointing forward to the Messiah.**  
🔥 **Religious leaders treated the Scriptures as the highest authority, sometimes even above God Himself.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined what it meant to hear God’s Word**:  
🔥 **God’s Word is not just written commandments—it is Jesus Himself.**  
🔥 **The Scriptures testify about Jesus, but they are not the final revelation—He is.**  
🔥 **Jesus did not contradict the Scriptures—He fulfilled them.**

> _"You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about Me, yet you refuse to come to Me to have life."_ (John 5:39-40)

🔥 **The Bible points to Jesus, but it is Jesus who gives life!**

This means:  
✅ **We do not worship a book—we worship the Living Word.**  
✅ **We read Scripture not just for knowledge, but to encounter Christ.**  
✅ **True understanding of God’s Word comes through knowing Jesus, not just memorizing verses.**

> _"The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."_ (John 1:14)

🔥 **The Church must transition from reading Scripture only for doctrine to reading it to know Jesus.**

### **New Covenant Reality: Jesus Is the Final Word**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **The Law was given as God’s revealed will.**
- **Prophets spoke messages from God to His people.**
- **People related to God primarily through written commands and religious rituals.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus is the full revelation of the Father.**  
✅ **We do not just follow written commandments—we follow the Living Word.**  
✅ **The Holy Spirit brings the Word to life, leading us into truth.**

Paul declared:

> _"For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."_ (2 Corinthians 3:6)

🔥 **Scripture without Jesus leads to legalism, but Scripture through Jesus leads to transformation.**

This means:  
✅ **The Bible must be interpreted through the lens of Christ.**  
✅ **The Old Testament was a shadow—Jesus is the reality.**  
✅ **The Gospel is not just written words—it is the living person of Jesus.**

> _"For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form."_ (Colossians 2:9)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a mindset that treats Scripture as static laws to a Spirit-led relationship with the Living Word.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Scripture as an Idol to Christ as the Center**

Many believers still live with **a misplaced understanding of God’s Word**:  
❌ **Some treat the Bible as God Himself rather than as a witness to Christ.**  
❌ **Others misuse Scripture by weaponizing verses without understanding Jesus’ heart.**  
❌ **Many read Scripture without seeking the Spirit’s revelation.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Jesus is the key to understanding all of Scripture.**  
🔥 **The Holy Spirit breathes life into the written Word.**  
🔥 **Scripture is authoritative, but Christ is the ultimate authority.**

Paul wrote:

> _"He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."_ (2 Corinthians 3:6)

🔥 **The Bible must be read through the Spirit, not just through intellect.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From treating the Bible as the final revelation to recognizing Jesus as the final revelation.**  
✅ **From using Scripture as a weapon to using it as a window into God’s heart.**  
✅ **From knowledge-based faith to Spirit-filled faith that encounters Christ in Scripture.**

> _"The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life."_ (John 6:63)

🔥 **We do not just read the Bible—we meet Jesus in the pages.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Encounters the Living Word**

The final destiny of the Church is **not just to follow religious texts, but to be transformed by Christ Himself.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever."_ (Isaiah 40:8)

John saw it:

> _"He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is the Word of God."_ (Revelation 19:13)

Jesus declared it:

> _"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away."_ (Matthew 24:35)

🔥 **The Church is not built on texts alone—it is built on the Living Word.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not just laws and teachings—it is the person of Christ.**  
🔥 **We are not just students of the Bible—we are disciples of Jesus.**

The world will not end **with believers arguing over texts**—  
🔥 **It will end with every knee bowing before the Living Word!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not worshiping a book—  
🔥 **She is longing for union with the Word made flesh!**
