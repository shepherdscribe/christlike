**The Scarlet Thread of Redemption** – The Bible isn’t about laws—it’s a **story leading to Christ**
_(From Law-Based Religion to the Grace-Filled Story of Christ)_

#### **Introduction: The Gospel Woven Through History**

The Bible is not just **a collection of stories**—it is **one continuous story**.

From **Genesis to Revelation**, a single theme is woven through its pages:  
🔥 **The redemption of mankind through the blood of the Lamb.**

This **scarlet thread of redemption** runs through:

- The **blood of the lamb** covering Israel during the Exodus.
- The **sacrificial system** in the Tabernacle and Temple.
- The **prophecies of the Suffering Servant** in Isaiah.
- The **blood-stained cross of Calvary**.

From the very beginning, **God was revealing His plan to redeem humanity through the sacrifice of Jesus**.

This means:  
✅ The Bible **is not a book of disconnected laws and stories—it is a prophetic revelation of Christ**.  
✅ Redemption **was not an afterthought—it was the plan from before creation**.  
✅ Salvation **was never through human effort—it was always through the blood of the Lamb**.

> _"He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake."_ (1 Peter 1:20)

🔥 **From Genesis to Revelation, the story of redemption has always pointed to Jesus.**

---

#### **Core Scripture: Luke 24:27**

_"And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Every Shadow in the Old Testament Finds Its Fulfillment in Jesus**

When Jesus walked with the disciples on the road to Emmaus, He **opened their eyes to see that the entire Old Testament was about Him**.

This means:  
🔥 **The Law was never about rules—it was a shadow of Christ’s righteousness.**  
🔥 **The sacrifices were never about appeasing God—they pointed to the Lamb of God.**  
🔥 **The prophets were never just predicting events—they were revealing Christ’s coming.**

|**Old Testament Shadow**|**Fulfilled in Christ**|
|---|---|
|The **animal sacrifice** in Eden to cover Adam & Eve|Jesus is the **Lamb slain from the foundation of the world** (Revelation 13:8)|
|Noah’s Ark saving a remnant from judgment|Jesus is our **Ark of salvation** (1 Peter 3:20-21)|
|The **blood of the lamb** on Israel’s doorposts in Exodus|Jesus is the **true Passover Lamb** (1 Corinthians 5:7)|
|The **manna from heaven** in the wilderness|Jesus is the **Bread of Life** (John 6:35)|
|The **bronze serpent** lifted up for healing|Jesus was **lifted up to bring eternal healing** (John 3:14-15)|
|Jonah in the belly of the fish for three days|Jesus was **in the tomb for three days and resurrected** (Matthew 12:40)|

🔥 **Every Old Testament story was pointing forward to Christ!**

This is why Jesus declared:

> _"These are the very Scriptures that testify about Me."_ (John 5:39)

The Bible **is not about laws and moral lessons**—it is about the unfolding **story of redemption through Jesus**.

The Church must transition from **seeing Scripture as a rulebook** to **seeing it as the revelation of Christ**.

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Are Covered by the Blood of the Lamb**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Sacrifices had to be repeated** because they only covered sin temporarily.
- **The people had no direct access to God**—only the High Priest could enter His presence once a year.
- **Salvation was based on obedience to the Law**, which no one could fully keep.

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus is the once-for-all sacrifice** (Hebrews 10:10).  
✅ **We have direct access to the Father through Christ** (Hebrews 4:16).  
✅ **Salvation is by grace, not by works** (Ephesians 2:8-9).

🔥 **The scarlet thread of redemption finds its climax in Jesus' blood, poured out for us.**

This means:  
✅ **We no longer need sacrifices—Jesus’ blood is enough.**  
✅ **We no longer strive for righteousness—Jesus has become our righteousness.**  
✅ **We no longer fear judgment—Jesus has already paid the price in full.**

> _"For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed... but with the precious blood of Christ, a Lamb without blemish or defect."_ (1 Peter 1:18-19)

🔥 **Your salvation is not based on how well you perform—it is based on Christ’s finished work!**

---

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Legalism to Living in Redemption**

Many believers today still struggle with **Old Covenant thinking**:  
❌ **They feel they must "earn" God’s love.**  
❌ **They see Christianity as following rules rather than following Christ.**  
❌ **They live in fear of failure rather than the confidence of redemption.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **We are not under Law—we are under grace.**  
🔥 **We are not servants trying to impress a Master—we are sons and daughters of the King.**  
🔥 **We do not strive for righteousness—we receive it through faith.**

> _"For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the Law, but under grace."_ (Romans 6:14)

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From striving for righteousness to resting in Christ.**  
✅ **From obeying out of fear to following out of love.**  
✅ **From religion to relationship.**

The scarlet thread of redemption does not say, **“Try harder.”**  
It says, **“It is finished.”**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Lives in the Fullness of Redemption**

The final destiny of the Church is **not judgment—it is glory with Christ**.

Isaiah saw it:

> _"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."_ (Isaiah 1:18)

John saw it:

> _"I saw a great multitude… standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: ‘Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!’"_ (Revelation 7:9-10)

🔥 **We will stand before God, clothed not in our works, but in the righteousness of Christ.**  
🔥 **The Lamb who was slain will reign as King, and we will reign with Him.**  
🔥 **The story of redemption will reach its final chapter—a glorious, eternal Kingdom in the presence of God.**

The end of the Bible does not show **fear, condemnation, or uncertainty**—it shows **a redeemed people worshiping the Lamb forever.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The story of redemption **is not about what we do for God**—it is about what **God has done for us through Jesus Christ**.

And when Christ returns, the final words will not be, **"You must try harder."**  
The final words will be:

🔥 **"Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Lord."** (Matthew 25:23)

The scarlet thread runs through history—but **its final destination is eternity in the presence of God**.
