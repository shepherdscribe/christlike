**The Valley of Dry Bones: Resurrection Power in the Midst of Death**  
_(Redemption Is Not Just Being Saved—It Is About Being Resurrected Into New Life)_

---

### **Introduction: Can These Bones Live?**

Many believers today walk through life **saved, but lifeless**—spiritually dry, weary, and without fresh vision. They know Christ, but they still live as though they are in exile, without the fullness of resurrection power.

🔥 **Redemption is not just about escaping sin—it is about stepping into new life.**

In Ezekiel 37, God takes the prophet to a valley full of dry bones—a picture of **lifelessness, hopelessness, and spiritual exile**.

> _"He asked me, ‘Son of man, can these bones live?’ I said, ‘Sovereign Lord, you alone know.’"_ (Ezekiel 37:3)

What follows is one of the greatest prophetic visions of **resurrection and restoration**—a glimpse into God’s desire not only to redeem His people but to bring them into **fullness of life**.

🔥 **The Church must transition from just being saved to living in resurrection power!**

### **Core Scripture: Ezekiel 37:5-6**

_"This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life. I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord."_

🔥 **God does not just restore form—He breathes life!**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Is Our Resurrection**

The **Valley of Dry Bones** is not just about Israel’s restoration—it is a shadow of the ultimate resurrection in Christ.

🔥 **The bones represent fallen humanity—lifeless without God.**  
🔥 **The breath represents the Holy Spirit—reviving what was dead.**  
🔥 **The prophecy finds fulfillment in Christ—who brings resurrection life to all.**

Jesus declares:

> _"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in Me will live, even though they die."_ (John 11:25)

Paul confirms:

> _"And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who lives in you."_ (Romans 8:11)

🔥 **The dry bones were not just a vision for Israel—they were a foreshadowing of the resurrection power of Jesus!**

### **New Covenant Reality: We Are Already Raised With Christ**

Many believers still live **as if they are spiritually dry**, believing: 
❌ **They are too broken to be revived.**  
❌ **They must strive to earn spiritual life.**  
❌ **Their past disqualifies them from full restoration.**

But the Gospel declares:

> _"Since we have been united with Him in His death, we will also be raised to life as He was."_ (Romans 6:5)

🔥 **You are not waiting for resurrection—you are already raised in Christ!**

This means: 
✅ **You are not spiritually lifeless—you carry the breath of God.**  
✅ **You are not just barely saved—you are fully alive in Him.**  
✅ **You are not waiting to be revived—resurrection life is already within you.**

Israel’s dry bones were **scattered, broken, and hopeless**—but when God spoke, **they stood up, a mighty army**.

🔥 **This is the Church’s destiny—to rise in resurrection power!**

> _"I will put My Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it."_ (Ezekiel 37:14)

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Dry Religion to Spirit-Empowered Life**

Many believers today still experience **dryness in their faith**: 
❌ **They go through the motions but lack passion.**  
❌ **They believe in Jesus but live without power.**  
❌ **They see miracles in the Bible but not in their own lives.**

But the early Church understood: 🔥 **The Holy Spirit is not a doctrine—He is a life-giving reality.**  
🔥 **Salvation is not just about going to heaven—it is about being filled with God now.**  
🔥 **We are not meant to be a valley of dry bones—we are called to be a living, breathing Body of Christ.**

> _"You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you."_ (Romans 8:9)

🔥 **The Church must transition from lifeless Christianity to Spirit-filled reality!**

The Church must: 
✅ **Stop striving and start receiving the breath of God.**  
✅ **Stop doubting and start walking in resurrection authority.**  
✅ **Stop waiting for revival and start living in the power of the risen Christ.**

🔥 **Resurrection power is not coming—it is already here!**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Resurrection Life**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to remain dry and lifeless**—it is to walk in the fullness of resurrection power!

Isaiah saw it:

> _"Your dead will live, Lord; their bodies will rise—let those who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy."_ (Isaiah 26:19)

Jesus declared it:

> _"Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live."_ (John 5:25)

Paul revealed it:

> _"We will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."_ (1 Corinthians 15:51-52)

🔥 **The Church is not called to be dry bones—we are called to be a living, breathing army of God!**

The world will not end with **a weak, struggling Church**—  
🔥 **It will end with a victorious Bride walking in resurrection life!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not lifeless—  
🔥 **She is fully alive, filled with the Spirit, walking in resurrection power!**
