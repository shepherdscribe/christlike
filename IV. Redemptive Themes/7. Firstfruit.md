**The Resurrection & the Firstfruits** – Christ’s resurrection wasn’t about proving power—it was about **revealing new life**
_(From Resurrection as an Event to Resurrection as a New Reality)_

#### **Introduction: Resurrection Is Not Just an Event—It’s the Beginning of a New Creation**

For many, the resurrection of Jesus is just a **historical event**—

- **A miracle proving He was the Son of God.**
- **A sign of victory over death.**
- **A confirmation that the Gospel is true.**

🔥 **But resurrection is more than a past event—it is the beginning of a new reality.**

Jesus' resurrection was not just about Him coming back to life.  
✅ **It was the first act of a new creation.**  
✅ **It was the guarantee that we, too, will be raised.**  
✅ **It was the moment where death itself began to be undone.**

Paul calls Jesus **"the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."**

> _"But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."_ (1 Corinthians 15:20)

🔥 **His resurrection was not an isolated event—it was the beginning of a restored humanity.**

The Church must transition **from seeing resurrection as a one-time event to living in the reality of resurrection life.**

> _"Because I live, you also will live."_ (John 14:19)

🔥 **Resurrection is not just about what happened to Jesus—it is about what is happening in us.**

#### **Core Scripture: Romans 6:4-5**

_"We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we will certainly also be united with Him in a resurrection like His."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus' Resurrection Marks the Birth of a New Humanity**

Before Christ, resurrection was a **mystery, a distant hope**:  
🔥 The prophets spoke of **a future resurrection, but they did not fully understand it**.  
🔥 The Jewish people believed in **a resurrection on the last day, but it was vague**.  
🔥 The disciples themselves **did not expect Jesus to rise until it happened**.

But when Jesus rose from the dead, something **radical** happened:

🔥 **He became the prototype of a new kind of human—fully redeemed, immortal, glorified.**  
🔥 **He was not just revived—He was resurrected into a body that would never die again.**  
🔥 **He was not just continuing life—He was ushering in the age to come.**

> _"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man."_ (1 Corinthians 15:21)

This means:  
✅ **Resurrection is not just about escaping death—it is about entering new life.**  
✅ **The Kingdom is not just about forgiveness—it is about renewal of all things.**  
✅ **Jesus did not just come to save us from sin—He came to make us fully alive.**

> _"Just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man."_ (1 Corinthians 15:49)

🔥 **Jesus’ resurrection is the first glimpse of what we will become.**

The Church must transition **from waiting for heaven to living as resurrected people now.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Already Live in the Power of Resurrection**

Under the Old Covenant:

- Death **was final—only shadows of resurrection existed.**
- The people of God **hoped for a future restoration, but it was uncertain.**
- Righteousness **was about law-keeping, not transformation into new life.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus has already conquered death.**  
✅ **We have already been spiritually resurrected.**  
✅ **We are already living in the power of the new creation.**

Paul declared:

> _"If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

🔥 **Resurrection life is not just in the future—it is happening in us now.**

This means:  
✅ **Eternal life is not something we wait for—it has already begun.**  
✅ **We do not fear death—it has already been defeated.**  
✅ **We do not wait to be transformed—we are already being made new.**

> _"The same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you."_ (Romans 8:11)

🔥 **The Church must transition from seeing resurrection as only a future event to living in resurrection power today.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Waiting for Resurrection to Walking in It Now**

Many believers today still live as if **they are waiting for resurrection**:  
❌ **They think of salvation as only about escaping hell, not living in new life.**  
❌ **They think of resurrection as only about the future, not affecting daily life.**  
❌ **They still fear death, instead of living in the power of victory over it.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **We have already been raised spiritually—our physical resurrection is just the final step.**  
🔥 **We do not need to wait to experience resurrection power—we live in it now.**  
🔥 **Death is no longer something to fear—it is a defeated enemy.**

Paul wrote:

> _"I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of His resurrection."_ (Philippians 3:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from waiting for transformation to living in it now.**

The resurrection of Jesus is not just a promise of the future—  
🔥 **It is a present reality shaping how we live today.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Resurrection Life**

The final destiny of the Church is **not escaping the world—it is resurrection and renewal.**

Daniel saw it:

> _"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake—some to everlasting life."_ (Daniel 12:2)

John saw it:

> _"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth... Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them."_ (Revelation 21:1-3)

Paul saw it:

> _"The last enemy to be destroyed is death."_ (1 Corinthians 15:26)

🔥 **We will not end in death—we will end in glory!**  
🔥 **We will not be spirits floating in the clouds—we will be resurrected, just like Jesus!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not just about going to heaven—it is about bringing heaven to earth through resurrection!**

The world will not end with **believers escaping into the sky**—  
🔥 **It will end with the resurrected saints reigning with Christ on a restored earth.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

Jesus is not just waiting to return—  
🔥 **He is preparing a resurrected people to reign with Him forever!**
