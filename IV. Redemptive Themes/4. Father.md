### **The Prodigal Son & the Father's Heart**
_(From Law-Based Religion to Christlike Sonship)_

#### **Introduction: The Shadow of a Distant Father**

The religious leaders of Jesus’ day had a rigid understanding of God—**a judge, a lawgiver, a master of slaves**. They knew the stories of Abraham, Moses, and David. They upheld the commandments, the temple rituals, the purity laws. And in their minds, God’s favor was **earned** through obedience and **lost** through failure.

When Jesus sat among them and said, **"A man had two sons..."**, the Pharisees leaned in, expecting a story of **justice and consequence**—the younger son would fall, and the father would uphold the law. But what Jesus revealed was not just a **parable**—it was a **revelation of a Father they had never truly known**.

#### **Core Scripture: Luke 15:11-32**

_"But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him."_ (Luke 15:20)

#### **The Christ Filter: The Father Was Never Far Away**

For centuries, the Jewish people lived under a **covenant of distance**. God dwelled in the temple, behind the veil. Access to Him was through **sacrifices, priests, and rituals**. Holiness meant **separation**—from sinners, from the unclean, from anything that might defile.

The **Pharisees still carried this mindset**, believing that righteousness meant drawing strict lines between the faithful and the fallen. In their world, **God waited for sinners to return in shame, not to embrace them while they were still filthy**.

But in this parable, Jesus shattered that image. **The Father was never far away.** He wasn’t standing at a distance, waiting for an apology. **He ran.** He didn’t demand restitution—**He restored instantly.**

Jesus was revealing something greater than the Old Covenant had ever shown: **The Father is not a distant judge, but a running Redeemer.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: From Servants to Sons**

The younger son had rehearsed his repentance speech:

> _"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants."_ (Luke 15:18-19)

This is the **Old Covenant mindset**—fall, repent, work your way back, hope for mercy. The son was willing to return **as a slave** because that’s how religion taught him to think.

But **Christlikeness rewrites the story**. Before the son could even finish his confession, the father interrupts him:

> _"Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate!"_ (Luke 15:22-23)

The father **ignored the son’s plea to become a servant**. **He wasn’t interested in hiring him back—he was restoring him as a son.**

This is the **New Covenant**: **Forgiveness before apology. Grace before guilt. Restoration before repentance is complete.**

In the Old Covenant, people were **servants** in the house of God. But in the New Covenant, through Christ, we are **sons and daughters**.

#### **Glorious Future: The Kingdom of the Embracing Father**

The older brother couldn’t understand. He saw his father through **the lens of law**—work hard, obey, be rewarded. He didn’t recognize the **Father’s true nature**—a love that restores beyond merit.

Even today, some believers still struggle to transition into **Christlikeness**. They hold onto **rules, performance, and self-righteousness**, hoping to earn what Christ has already freely given.

But the Kingdom is not built on **servants earning wages**—it is built on **sons receiving inheritance**.

**The Father is still running toward us.**  
**Still restoring what was lost.**  
**Still celebrating every son and daughter who comes home.**

Because **this is who God has always been—but only in Christ do we fully see Him.**
