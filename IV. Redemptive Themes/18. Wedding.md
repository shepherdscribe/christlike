**The Wedding Feast of the Lamb** – The Gospel isn’t about exclusion, but **union with Christ**
_(From Exclusionary Theology to the Fullness of Union with Christ)_

#### **Introduction: The Grand Celebration of the Kingdom**

Throughout Scripture, **God’s relationship with His people is often described as a marriage**.

- In the Old Testament, Israel was called **the bride of Yahweh** (Isaiah 54:5, Hosea 2:19).
- In the New Testament, the Church is called **the Bride of Christ** (Ephesians 5:25-27).
- And at the climax of history, we see **the great Wedding Feast of the Lamb** (Revelation 19:7-9).

🔥 **Salvation is not just about avoiding judgment—it is about being invited into a wedding!**

Jesus told parables about a **wedding banquet** (Matthew 22:1-14), emphasizing:  
✅ **The Kingdom is a feast, not a courtroom.**  
✅ **God is not looking for perfect people—He is calling the willing.**  
✅ **The Gospel is an invitation, not an obligation.**

> _"Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!"_ (Revelation 19:9)

🔥 **The Church must transition from an exclusionary mindset to a Gospel of invitation, celebration, and union with Christ.**

#### **Core Scripture: Revelation 19:7-9**

_"Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready… Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!"_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Wedding Feast Is About Union, Not Just Reward**

Many see salvation as simply **escaping hell**—  
🔥 **But the Bible presents salvation as a wedding feast—an eternal union with Christ.**

Before Christ, religious systems were built on:

- **Temple sacrifices** (transactional relationship with God).
- **Obedience to laws** (performance-based righteousness).
- **Priestly mediators** (distance from God’s presence).

But when Jesus came, He **redefined salvation as a wedding**:  
🔥 **He is not just the King—we are His Bride.**  
🔥 **He is not just our Savior—He is our Beloved.**  
🔥 **He is not just calling us to obey Him—He is calling us to be one with Him.**

> _"As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you."_ (Isaiah 62:5)

🔥 **Salvation is not just about what we are saved from—it is about what we are saved for: UNION with Jesus!**

This means:  
✅ **Heaven is not just a place—it is intimacy with Christ.**  
✅ **The Gospel is not just about avoiding wrath—it is about being the Bride of Christ.**  
✅ **Christianity is not about law-keeping—it is about love and relationship.**

> _"I will betroth you to Me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion."_ (Hosea 2:19)

🔥 **The Church must transition from an "escape theology" to a theology of divine union.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Are Already Betrothed to Christ**

Under the Old Covenant:

- Relationship with God **was mediated through the Law and sacrifices.**
- Worshipers **were separate from God’s presence.**
- Sin **was temporarily covered, but true intimacy with God was distant.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus has purchased the Bride with His own blood.**  
✅ **We already have access to the Father.**  
✅ **The Holy Spirit is the engagement ring, guaranteeing what is to come.**

Paul declared:

> _"I promised you to one husband, to Christ, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Him."_ (2 Corinthians 11:2)

🔥 **We are not just waiting for heaven—we are already the Bride of Christ!**

This means:  
✅ **We are not working for salvation—we are preparing for the wedding.**  
✅ **We are not servants trying to prove our worth—we are the Bride, already chosen.**  
✅ **We are not guests at the feast—we are the ones for whom the feast is prepared!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

🔥 **The Church must transition from striving to rest in the joy of being His Bride.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Gatekeepers to Wedding Invitations**

Many believers still operate with **an exclusionary mindset**:  
❌ **They see salvation as a contract, not a covenant.**  
❌ **They focus on who is “in” and who is “out” instead of proclaiming the invitation.**  
❌ **They act as gatekeepers instead of joyful messengers of the wedding feast.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **The Gospel is an invitation to all, not just the "worthy."**  
🔥 **Jesus invites the broken, the outcasts, the undeserving.**  
🔥 **The wedding feast is about GRACE, not about law-keeping.**

Jesus told a parable:

> _"The Kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son… He sent his servants to those who had been invited, but they refused to come… Then he said, ‘Go to the highways and invite everyone you find!’"_ (Matthew 22:2-9)

🔥 **The Church is not called to restrict the invitation—it is called to proclaim it!**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From focusing on judgment to announcing the wedding invitation.**  
✅ **From exclusivity to radical grace.**  
✅ **From seeing the Gospel as a transaction to seeing it as a love story.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Reigns as the Bride of Christ**

The final destiny of the Church is **not standing in fear before a judge—it is standing in joy before the Bridegroom.**

Isaiah saw it:

> _"The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces; He will remove His people’s disgrace from all the earth. The Lord has spoken."_ (Isaiah 25:8)

John saw it:

> _"Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: 'Hallelujah! For the Lord our God Almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has made herself ready!'"_ (Revelation 19:6-7)

Paul saw it:

> _"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for her, to present her to Himself as a radiant Church, without stain or wrinkle or any blemish, but holy and blameless."_ (Ephesians 5:25-27)

🔥 **The Church will not end as a struggling people—it will end as a glorified Bride.**  
🔥 **The world will not end in fear and destruction—it will end in the Wedding Feast of the Lamb!**  
🔥 **The final revelation of the Church is not about rules—it is about union with Christ!**

The world will not end **with believers barely making it into heaven**—  
🔥 **It will end with a victorious, radiant Bride reigning with Christ forever.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not cowering in fear—  
🔥 **She is standing in love, ready for the Wedding Feast of the Lamb!**
