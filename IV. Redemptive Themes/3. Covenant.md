**The Blood Covenant & the Mercy Seat** – Sacrifice ended because **Jesus fulfilled it all**
_(From Temporary Atonement to the Final, Perfect Sacrifice of Christ)_

#### **Introduction: The Power of the Blood Covenant**

From the earliest pages of Scripture, **covenants** were sealed with **blood**.

- When God made a covenant with **Noah**, a sacrifice was offered (Genesis 8:20-21).
- When God made a covenant with **Abraham**, animals were slain, and God passed through the blood (Genesis 15:9-10, 17).
- When God made a covenant with **Moses and Israel**, the blood of animals was sprinkled on the altar and the people (Exodus 24:6-8).

🔥 **In every covenant, blood was the price of relationship with God.**

But all these sacrifices were temporary.  
✅ **They covered sin—but they could not remove it.**  
✅ **They delayed judgment—but they could not cleanse the heart.**  
✅ **They pointed forward—but they were not the final answer.**

The Old Covenant **depended on repeated sacrifices**—  
The New Covenant **rests on one perfect sacrifice: Jesus Christ.**

> _"This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."_ (Matthew 26:28)

🔥 **The blood of Jesus did what no other sacrifice could do—bring full, final atonement and restore direct access to God.**

#### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 9:12**

_"He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Mercy Seat Was a Shadow—Jesus Is the Reality**

In the Tabernacle and later the Temple, the **Ark of the Covenant** was placed in the Holy of Holies, and its covering—the **Mercy Seat**—was where atonement was made.

🔥 Once a year, on **the Day of Atonement**, the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies and sprinkle the blood of an innocent sacrifice on the **Mercy Seat** (Leviticus 16:15-16).

- This act **covered Israel’s sins for another year**.
- The people were **forgiven, but only temporarily**.
- The sacrifice had to be **repeated over and over**.

But when Jesus came:  
🔥 **He became the final High Priest.**  
🔥 **He became the final Sacrifice.**  
🔥 **He became the true Mercy Seat.**

> _"God presented Christ as a Mercy Seat through the shedding of His blood—to be received by faith."_ (Romans 3:25, CSB)

🔥 **The cross is now the Mercy Seat—where the blood of Jesus fully satisfies the justice of God.**

This means:  
✅ **No more annual sacrifices—Jesus paid for sin once for all.**  
✅ **No more barriers—Jesus tore the veil and gave us direct access to the Father.**  
✅ **No more temporary forgiveness—Jesus' blood cleanses completely.**

The Church must transition **from seeing salvation as temporary forgiveness to understanding the finality of Christ’s atonement.**

> _"By one sacrifice, He has made perfect forever those who are being made holy."_ (Hebrews 10:14)

🔥 **You are not just forgiven—you are made new!**

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Now Have Direct Access to the Father**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Only the High Priest** could enter the Holy of Holies.
- **The presence of God** was separated from the people by a thick veil.
- **Worship was distant**—God’s people had to rely on priests to approach Him.

But when Jesus died, something extraordinary happened:

> _"At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom."_ (Matthew 27:51)

🔥 The veil was torn—meaning:  
✅ **No more separation—every believer has direct access to God.**  
✅ **No more waiting for a priest—we can enter His presence boldly.**  
✅ **No more fear of judgment—Jesus has become our Mercy Seat forever.**

> _"Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

🔥 **The Church must transition from Old Covenant distance to New Covenant intimacy with the Father.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Temporary Forgiveness to Eternal Redemption**

Many believers today still live with an **Old Covenant mindset**:  
❌ **They feel they need to "get right with God" every time they fail.**  
❌ **They live in fear, wondering if they are still saved.**  
❌ **They believe their forgiveness depends on how well they "maintain" their faith.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Salvation is not temporary—it is eternal.**  
🔥 **Forgiveness is not conditional—it is complete in Christ.**  
🔥 **We do not strive to stay in God’s grace—we rest in the finished work of Jesus.**

Paul declared:

> _"In Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace."_ (Ephesians 1:7)

🔥 **You are not moving in and out of salvation—you are securely held in Christ!**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From temporary atonement to eternal redemption.**  
✅ **From striving to be forgiven to resting in the finished work of Christ.**  
✅ **From guilt and condemnation to confidence in grace.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in the Fullness of Redemption**

The final destiny of the Church is **not judgment—it is reigning in the fullness of Christ’s redemption.**

Daniel saw it:

> _"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the Kingdom and possess it forever—yes, forever and ever!"_ (Daniel 7:18)

John saw it:

> _"They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads."_ (Revelation 22:4)

Paul saw it:

> _"We will reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!"_ (Romans 5:17)

🔥 **We are not just saved—we are co-heirs with Christ.**  
🔥 **We are not just forgiven—we are transformed into His image.**  
🔥 **We are not just waiting for Heaven—we are walking in Kingdom authority now.**

The world will not end **in fear and uncertainty for the saints**—  
It will end **with the fully redeemed Church standing before the Lamb, covered in His blood, reigning with Him forever.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

When Christ returns, He will not see a Church **cowering in guilt and shame**—  
He will see a **Bride clothed in white, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, and seated with Him in glory.**

🔥 **The Blood Covenant is not about fear—it is about the eternal love and security we have in Christ.**
