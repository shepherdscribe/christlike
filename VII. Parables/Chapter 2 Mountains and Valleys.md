# Revelation in Mountains & Valleys

_In Christ, the heights and the depths are both places of revelation._

### **Introduction: The Peaks and the Depths**

We often search for God in the high places. The moments of triumph, the breakthroughs, the seasons when everything seems to rise. We stand on our own mountains and assume this is where God speaks the loudest. But the story of Scripture shows us something deeper.

God reveals Himself on the mountains, but He also speaks in the valleys. His voice is not limited to the summit. His presence is not withheld in the low places. The mountain and the valley are both sacred ground in the hands of the Shepherd.

ðŸ”¥ God does not abandon us in the valleys. He walks with us there.  
ðŸ”¥ God is not only near when we ascend. He is near when we fall.

Mountaintops and valleys are part of the same journey. Both are places of revelation. Both reveal the faithful hand of God.

### **Core Scripture: Psalm 23:4, Exodus 19:20, Matthew 17:1-2**

"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me." (Psalm 23:4)

"The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain." (Exodus 19:20)

"After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain. There He was transfigured before them." (Matthew 17:1-2)

### **The Christ Filter: His Presence in Every Season**

Moses met God on the mountain. The people trembled at the base while Moses ascended into the cloud. On that mountain, the Law was given. But the mountain was not just a place of rules. It was a place where God drew near.

Later, Jesus took His disciples up a mountain and was transfigured before them. His glory was revealed. His face shone like the sun. They saw a glimpse of who He truly is. Peter wanted to stay there. He wanted to build shelters and remain in the brilliance. But the story did not stop on the mountain. Jesus led them back down. The valley was waiting. The cross was still ahead.

The valley of the shadow of death is not just a poetic line. It is a place many walk through. In those depths, God does not speak from a distance. He is present. He does not shout from the summit. He walks beside His sheep.

ðŸ”¥ Christ is present in the heights and the depths.  
ðŸ”¥ Christ reveals His glory on the mountain and His comfort in the valley.

The Church must stop separating seasons of joy from seasons of sorrow. Both are places where the Shepherd speaks.

### **New Covenant Reality: The Shepherd Walks with Us**

Under the old system, the mountain was often a place of fear. The people stayed at a distance. The presence of God was wrapped in smoke and thunder. But in Christ, the story has changed.

ðŸ”¥ We no longer stand far off. We are welcomed to draw near.  
ðŸ”¥ We no longer wait for a representative. Christ Himself walks with us.

The valleys that once meant abandonment now become places of intimacy. The mountains that once meant terror now become places of transformation.

The Shepherd does not lead from a distance. He walks with us. He reveals Himself not only in power but also in nearness.

ðŸ”¥ In the New Covenant, every step of the journey becomes sacred because He is present.

### **The Churchâ€™s Own Transition: From Escaping the Valleys to Embracing the Journey**

Many have taught believers to chase the mountaintop and fear the valley. But the Church must embrace the whole landscape. The Spirit of God is not only found in the victories. He is present in the silence, in the waiting, in the descent.

ðŸ”¥ The Church must not promise endless mountains. It must teach how to walk faithfully in the valley.  
ðŸ”¥ We must stop seeing the valley as punishment and start seeing it as the ground where trust is built.

Some have built ministries that only celebrate the climb. But the Shepherd is not found only in the ascent. He is with us in the steps that feel like loss. He is present when prayers feel unanswered.

The Church must walk with people in both places. It must speak of a God who is faithful on the peaks and in the depths.

### **Glorious Future: A Journey Where He Is Always Near**

The final story is not a life without valleys. It is a life where the Shepherd leads all the way home. The high places and the low places will both speak of His faithfulness.

David saw it. "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me." (Psalm 23:4)

Moses met God on the mountain. Jesus was transfigured on the mountain. But the cross was embraced in the valley. The resurrection broke forth from the place of sorrow.

ðŸ”¥ The Church will not be known for mountain moments alone. It will be known as the people who walk with the Shepherd, who trust His hand in every season.  
ðŸ”¥ The story will not end with us trapped in the valley. It will end with the Lamb leading His people into eternal green pastures.  
ðŸ”¥ The Bride will not wander without direction. She will follow the voice of her Shepherd to the very end.
