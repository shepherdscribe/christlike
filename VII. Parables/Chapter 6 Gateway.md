# Dungeon & Sanctuary: Christ as the Gateway to Inner Healing

_The heart can be a prison or a resting place. In Christ, it becomes a sanctuary._

### **Introduction: The Hidden Rooms of the Soul**

There are places in the human heart that few dare to visit. Locked rooms where memories are buried, where wounds remain unspoken, where guilt and shame have built their own walls. Some hearts have become dungeons. The chains are quiet, but they are heavy.

Others have found that the presence of Christ can turn the darkest places into sanctuaries of peace. What was once a prison can become holy ground. What was once a locked cell can become a place of healing.

ðŸ”¥ Christ does not just stand at the door. He enters. He brings light into rooms we thought would always remain shut.  
ðŸ”¥ The heart was not made to be a dungeon. It was made to be His dwelling place.

### **Core Scripture: Revelation 3:20, Psalm 32:7, Isaiah 61:1**

"Here I am. I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with Me." (Revelation 3:20)

"You are my hiding place. You will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance." (Psalm 32:7)

"He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners." (Isaiah 61:1)

### **The Christ Filter: The One Who Transforms the Room**

Christ stands at the door of every heart. He knocks, not to condemn, but to enter. He does not come as a stranger. He comes as a healer. He is not afraid of what He will find behind the locked doors.

ðŸ”¥ Christ enters places others walk away from.  
ðŸ”¥ The chains do not intimidate Him. The darkness does not push Him back.

The psalmist said, "You are my hiding place." Not a dungeon, but a refuge. The places where we used to hide in shame become places where we now hide in Him. The walls that once kept light out become walls that now carry the sound of His songs of deliverance.

When Jesus read from Isaiah, He declared His purpose. He came to bind the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives, to release prisoners from darkness. His healing is not distant. It moves into the places we have locked away.

ðŸ”¥ Christ does not simply visit our pain. He transforms it.  
ðŸ”¥ The rooms we call dungeons can become sanctuaries when His presence fills them.

### **New Covenant Reality: His Dwelling Place Is Within Us**

Under the old system, the presence of God was tied to a temple, to external places. But in the New Covenant, His dwelling place is the human heart. The temple is no longer made of stone. It is living. It is us.

ðŸ”¥ The New Covenant is not about a God who visits. It is about a God who abides.  
ðŸ”¥ Christ does not wait for us to clean the room. He comes in to do the healing Himself.

The sanctuary is not reserved for the perfect. It is built in the middle of broken hearts where His grace is received. The same heart that once echoed with shame now becomes the place where His songs are heard.

### **The Churchâ€™s Own Transition: From Superficial Healing to Deep Restoration**

Some churches have stayed on the surface, teaching people to decorate their dungeons instead of opening the door for Christ to enter. They teach management, not freedom. They teach behavior, not transformation.

ðŸ”¥ The Church must stop offering decorations for chains. It must proclaim true deliverance.  
ðŸ”¥ We are not called to help people cope with locked rooms. We are called to invite Christ in to bring healing.

The Church must lead people beyond appearance. It must lead them to inner healing. To freedom. To restoration. The gospel is not a message that helps us look better. It is a message that frees us from what holds us inside.

The invitation is not to visit the sanctuary. It is to become one.

### **Glorious Future: A Church at Home in His Presence**

The final Church will not be a people hiding in inner prisons. It will be a people who walk freely in the sanctuary of His presence.

The story will not close with locked hearts. It will close with hearts wide open, filled with light, resting in the security of Christ.

ðŸ”¥ The Church will not be remembered for teaching people to survive their dungeons. It will be known for leading them into the sanctuary of the Shepherdâ€™s love.  
ðŸ”¥ The final gathering will not be marked by silent captives. It will be marked by those who sing songs of deliverance.  
ðŸ”¥ The Bride will not arrive at the end bound in fear. She will arrive free, whole, and at home in His presence.

The dungeon is not the end of the story. The sanctuary is.
