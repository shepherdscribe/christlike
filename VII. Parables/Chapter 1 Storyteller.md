# The Living Word: Christ, the Divine Storyteller

_Jesus does not just tell stories. He invites us into His._

### **Introduction: The Stories That Shape Us**

Stories live in us. Some we inherited. Some were written by pain. Some were handed to us by voices that said we would never be enough. Many live under stories that speak of failure, fear, and endless striving. The world tells us to write our own story, to fight for our own ending, to carry the weight of the pen. But from the beginning, there has always been a greater Storyteller.

The Word was already there. Before light filled the earth, the Word was present, speaking. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (John 1:1) He is not distant. He is not silent. The Author still writes.

ðŸ”¥ Jesus does not simply tell stories. He enters them. He rewrites them. He redeems them.

The parables of Jesus were not clever examples. They were open doors. Through them, He invited us to see the Kingdom hidden in plain sight. A mustard seed. A lost coin. A wandering son. Each story carried more than it seemed.

The prodigal son was not just a reckless child. He was a mirror to all of us. The story was always about the Father who runs to embrace. The Good Shepherd was not just an image. It was Christ revealing Himself. The Shepherd who searches. The Shepherd who carries. The Shepherd who never forgets the one.

His stories were never random. They were always windows into the heart of God.

### **Core Scripture: John 1:1, John 1:14, Matthew 13:35**

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (John 1:1)

"The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." (John 1:14)

"I will open My mouth in parables. I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world." (Matthew 13:35)

### **The Christ Filter: Seeing Jesus Through Every Story**

When Abraham led Isaac up the mountain, the story was never just about a fatherâ€™s obedience. It was a shadow pointing forward to another hill and another Son. Isaac was spared, but Christ would not be. Abraham said, "God will provide for Himself the lamb." (Genesis 22:8) And God did. The lamb was provided, not in that moment, but at the cross.

When Ezekiel walked among the valley of dry bones, he asked the question many still ask today. "Can these bones live?" Ezekiel answered honestly, "Only You, Lord, know." (Ezekiel 37:3) The Living Word is the One who breathes life into what seems beyond repair. He speaks and dead things rise. He speaks and scattered bones find their place again.

Jonahâ€™s three days in the belly of the fish were more than the story of a reluctant prophet. His descent pointed to the One who would enter the grave and rise again. Joseph was thrown into the pit by his brothers and later became their rescuer. His life whispers of Christ, the One rejected by His own but raised to save them.

ðŸ”¥ The Scriptures were never disconnected stories. They were always leading us to Jesus.  
ðŸ”¥ Christ is not only the Author. He is present in every story, shaping every moment.

The Bible does not give us lessons stacked side by side. It gives us a pattern of redemption that always finds its fullness in Christ.

### **New Covenant Reality: He Enters Our Story**

Many carry stories they wish they could tear out. Chapters marked by shame, regret, or silence. But the Living Word does not discard these pages. He steps into them.

Under the Old Covenant, the people waited for prophets to speak on their behalf. They stood at a distance, behind veils, separated from the holy places. But in Christ, the distance is gone. The veil is torn. The Word has come near.

ðŸ”¥ The New Covenant is not a story written from afar. It is a story written with us and in us.  
ðŸ”¥ Jesus does not speak to us from a mountain. He walks with us in the valley.

The parts of our story we have buried, the moments we have tried to forget, the ordinary days we have overlooked, He gathers them all. He writes redemption into every corner.

### **The Churchâ€™s Own Transition: From Striving to Surrender**

Many still fight to write their own story. They grasp for control, believing they must secure their own name and find their own place. But the story written by our own hands will always fall short.

The Church must surrender the pen. The Church must lay down the desire to build its own glory. The Author is not waiting for us to prove ourselves. He is waiting for us to trust Him with the story He is writing.

ðŸ”¥ We were never called to fight for our own significance. We were made to surrender to the Author.  
ðŸ”¥ We were never made to build our own story. We were made to be part of His.

The story unfolding is not about building platforms or chasing recognition. It is about the Shepherd who finds the lost, the Father who runs to embrace, the Lamb who redeems. The Church is not called to write a legacy. It is called to live inside the story of the Lamb.

### **Glorious Future: A Story That Will Not Fade**

One day the story will be fully revealed. The parts that seemed unfinished will find their purpose. The silent prayers, the hidden moments, the chapters we could not understand, will come together in His glory.

The Author is faithful. He will finish what He started. The Church will not end as scattered pages. It will stand as a story fully gathered in His hand. The Bride will not wander. She will follow the voice of her Shepherd.

ðŸ”¥ The final story is not one of confusion. It is a story of victory.  
ðŸ”¥ The final chapter is not uncertain. It is written in the Lambâ€™s Book of Life.  
ðŸ”¥ The story will not end with us struggling to find the way. It will end with the Shepherd leading us home.
