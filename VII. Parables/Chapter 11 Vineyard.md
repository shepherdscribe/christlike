# The True Vine & The Living Water: Christ as the Source of Life

_Life flows not from effort but from connection to the Source._

### **Introduction: The Wells We Draw From**

Everyone is drawing from something. Some pull from shallow wells that dry up quickly. Others cling to broken cisterns that cannot hold water. Many try to live by their own strength, only to find their wells empty when life grows heavy.

But Jesus stands before us as the True Vine and the Living Water. He is not one source among many. He is the source. He is the well that never runs dry. He is the Vine that supplies what no branch can produce on its own.

ðŸ”¥ Life in Christ is not sustained by effort. It is sustained by remaining connected to Him.  
ðŸ”¥ The well does not ask us to dig. It asks us to come and drink.

### **Core Scripture: John 15:5, John 4:13-14, Jeremiah 2:13**

"I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in Me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from Me you can do nothing." (John 15:5)

"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life." (John 4:13-14)

"My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken Me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water." (Jeremiah 2:13)

### **The Christ Filter: Remaining, Drinking, Living**

Jesus is not simply the Provider of life. He is the Source of it. The branch has no life apart from the Vine. The thirsty soul has no satisfaction apart from the Living Water.

ðŸ”¥ The life we long for is not found in distant places. It flows from Him.  
ðŸ”¥ Remaining is not a task. It is the natural connection that sustains us.

When Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well, He did not offer her another place to draw water. He offered her Himself. A spring of water that would never run dry. She had known many wells, but none had satisfied her soul.

The vine does not demand the branch to produce. It simply invites the branch to stay connected. The water does not demand the thirsty to perform. It simply invites them to drink.

ðŸ”¥ The life of the Kingdom flows from abiding, not striving.  
ðŸ”¥ The wells of the world run dry. The well of Christ flows forever.

### **New Covenant Reality: A Well Within Us, A Vine That Holds Us**

In the Old Covenant, the people often dug their own wells, built their own systems, and clung to the visible. They labored to store water that could not last.

But in the New Covenant, Christ places the well within us. The spring is no longer external. It flows from His Spirit living in us. The Vine holds the branch close. The Source moves with the branch wherever it grows.

ðŸ”¥ The New Covenant gives us the well we no longer have to chase.  
ðŸ”¥ The New Covenant gives us a Vine that never lets go.

The flow of life is no longer dependent on location, ritual, or human strength. It is rooted in Christ, who supplies what we need in every season.

### **The Churchâ€™s Own Transition: From Shallow Wells to Deep Life in Christ**

Some churches have led people to shallow wellsâ€”wells of self-effort, performance, and temporary satisfaction. They have taught people to dig harder instead of to drink deeper.

ðŸ”¥ The Church must stop pointing people to empty cisterns. It must lead them to the Living Water.  
ðŸ”¥ We must stop building systems that exhaust people and start nurturing spaces that help them remain in Christ.

Many are tired because they have been taught to produce life instead of receive it. But the Church is called to remain in the Vine, to draw from the well that does not run dry.

ðŸ”¥ The Churchâ€™s strength is not in how hard it works but in how deeply it abides.

We are not called to carry dry branches. We are called to be alive in the Vine.

### **Glorious Future: A Church Fully Alive in the Source**

The final Church will not be withered by thirst. She will stand as a flourishing vine, alive in the life of her Shepherd.

The story will not close with empty wells and broken cisterns. It will close with a Church drinking deeply from the well that flows forever.

ðŸ”¥ The Church will not be remembered for how much it built in its own strength. It will be remembered for how fully it remained in Christ.  
ðŸ”¥ The story will not end with branches cut off and cast aside. It will end with a Bride who is fully alive, fully nourished, fully connected to her Source.  
ðŸ”¥ The Bride will not arrive at the end dry and weary. She will come as one who has drunk deeply from the Living Water and who bears much fruit in the Vine.

The Source has always been enough.
