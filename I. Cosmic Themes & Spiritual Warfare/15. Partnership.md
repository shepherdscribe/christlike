**The Wisdom of God: Triumphing Over Evil Through Partnership with the New Humanity**  
_(How God Overcomes Darkness Without Destroying Free Will)_

---

### **Introduction: Why Doesn’t God Just Eliminate Evil?**

Many wonder why God, in His infinite power, does not simply **wipe out all evil instantly**. If He is all-powerful, why does He allow wickedness to persist?

❌ **Some assume that God’s delay means He is passive.**  
❌ **Others believe that evil exists because God is waiting for the right time to destroy it.**  
❌ **Many think that eradicating evil must involve force and divine judgment alone.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:

🔥 **God does not triumph over evil by force—He overcomes it through wisdom.**  
🔥 **If He destroyed evil immediately, He would have to remove free will.**  
🔥 **Instead, He chooses to defeat darkness through His people—the new humanity in Christ.**

> _"God’s intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms."_ (Ephesians 3:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from expecting God to remove evil to recognizing our role in overcoming it.**

### **Core Scripture: 2 Corinthians 5:17-20**

> _"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation."_

🔥 **God’s solution to evil is not destruction—it is transformation through the new humanity.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Did Not Destroy Evil—He Disarmed It**

Before Christ, **mankind was under bondage to sin, and evil had dominion**:

🔥 **The enemy ruled the nations through deception (2 Corinthians 4:4).**  
🔥 **The Law exposed sin but could not transform the heart (Romans 3:20).**  
🔥 **People were trapped under spiritual oppression without power to overcome.**

But when Jesus came, **He did not wipe out sinners—He launched a new humanity**:

🔥 **He disarmed the powers of darkness, making a spectacle of them (Colossians 2:15).**  
🔥 **He created a people who would continue His Kingdom expansion (Matthew 28:18-19).**  
🔥 **Instead of erasing free will, He empowered the new humanity to enforce righteousness.**

> _"For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves."_ (Colossians 1:13)

🔥 **Jesus did not come to destroy sinners but to create a new creation that overcomes evil.**

This means: ✅ **God’s plan is not to eliminate evil through destruction—it is to overcome it through transformation.**  
✅ **We are not waiting for Him to act—He is waiting for us to enforce His Kingdom.**  
✅ **The new humanity is not passive—we are the solution to darkness.**

> _"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."_ (John 1:5)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a mindset of waiting for deliverance to actively bringing transformation.**

### **New Covenant Reality: The Church as God’s Governing Force**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **God often dealt with evil through judgment and direct intervention.**
- **The Law exposed sin but could not regenerate the human heart.**
- **Israel’s victories often came through military conquest, not spiritual transformation.**

But under the New Covenant: ✅ **God’s strategy is to change the world through the Body of Christ.**  
✅ **The enemy is not waiting for destruction—he fears the Church walking in its authority.**  
✅ **We are co-laborers with Christ, enforcing His Kingdom on earth.**

Paul declared:

> _"Do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world?"_ (1 Corinthians 6:2)

🔥 **If we are called to reign with Christ, we must act as Kingdom enforcers, not passive observers.**

This means: ✅ **Evil persists where the Church fails to exercise dominion.**  
✅ **Spiritual transformation is a greater force than divine judgment.**  
✅ **The final victory over evil is not God acting alone—it is God acting through His people.**

> _"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden."_ (Matthew 5:14)

🔥 **The Church must transition from expecting divine intervention to stepping into divine partnership.**

### **Glorious Future: The New Humanity Ruling with Christ**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to be rescued but to reign with Christ over a restored creation**.

> _"To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne."_ (Revelation 3:21)

🔥 **We are not meant to escape the world—we are meant to transform it!**

> _"The creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."_ (Romans 8:19)

🔥 **The world is not waiting for destruction—it is waiting for the manifestation of the new humanity!**

🚀 **We are not waiting for God to destroy evil—we are enforcing His reign!**  
👑 **We are not powerless against darkness—we are the light that drives it out!**  
🔥 **We are not passive participants—we are Kingdom rulers being trained to reign!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not waiting for the war to end—  
🔥 **She is advancing the Kingdom, reigning with her King, and enforcing His dominion!**
