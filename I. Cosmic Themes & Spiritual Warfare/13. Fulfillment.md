**Signs of the End: Fulfilled, Yet Unfolding** – Christ-centered eschatology shifts from fear to **hope and renewal**
_(Transitioning from Fear-Based Eschatology to the Victorious Kingdom of Christ)_

#### **Introduction: The Misunderstood End**

For generations, believers have read Jesus’ words in **Matthew 24** with a sense of dread. Wars. Famines. Earthquakes. The love of many growing cold.

And for centuries, **every generation** has believed that they were the last.  
That the world was about to collapse.  
That destruction was imminent.
That the Kingdom was something **waiting to come, rather than something already here**.

But what if we have misunderstood the **signs of the end**?  
What if we are not at the edge of destruction, but in the **midst of restoration**?  
What if the "last days" were not a prophecy for the **far future**, but a reality that began **2,000 years ago**?

And what if the greatest misunderstanding of all is this—**the Kingdom is not coming in the way we expected, because it has already begun.**

#### **Core Scripture: Matthew 24:34**

_"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."_

---

#### **The Christ Filter: The End of an Age, Not the End of the World**

The disciples asked Jesus **three questions** in Matthew 24:3:

1. **When will this happen?** _(referring to the destruction of the temple)_
2. **What will be the sign of Your coming?**
3. **What will be the sign of the end of the age?**

For years, people have read this passage **assuming Jesus was speaking about the end of the world.**

But Jesus was not predicting the end of the world—He was predicting the end of **the Old Covenant age**.

> _"Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."_ (Matthew 24:2)

And in **AD 70, just 40 years later**, Jerusalem fell. The Temple was destroyed. The sacrificial system ended.

The Old Covenant had **passed away**, and the Kingdom of Christ **was now advancing without restriction.**

The "end times" were not about the **end of the earth**. They were about the **end of an era—the transition from law to grace, from temple worship to Spirit-filled believers, from the old world to the new creation.**

The Great Tribulation, the wars, the persecution—it was all fulfilled **within that generation**, just as Jesus said.

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Kingdom is Already Expanding**

Many still live **as if the Kingdom is far away**, waiting for a future moment when Jesus will reign.

But Jesus did not say, **“One day, I will establish My Kingdom.”**  
He said, **“The Kingdom of God is within you.”** (Luke 17:21)

> _"The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the Gospel!"_ (Mark 1:15)

This is the shift from **fear-based eschatology** to **Kingdom-centered restoration**:  
✅ **The "last days" were the last days of the Old Covenant, not the last days of the earth.**  
✅ **The Great Tribulation was fulfilled in AD 70, just as Jesus predicted.**  
✅ **The Kingdom is already here, already growing, already advancing.**

Jesus did not return to build a new temple—**He made His people the temple.**

He did not return to reign from an earthly throne—**He ascended to reign from Heaven.**

The early Church was learning something **radical**—the Kingdom was **not political, not military, not a physical nation**.

It was **spiritual, unstoppable, eternal.**

And the gates of hell would **never** prevail against it.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Expectation to Participation**

For too long, the Church has **waited for Christ to return and set things right**, instead of **walking in His power to transform the world now**.

The first disciples had to make this transition:

- **From waiting for a military Messiah to embracing a reigning King.**
- **From expecting political overthrow to seeing hearts transformed.**
- **From hoping for an earthly kingdom to realizing they were already part of a heavenly one.**

The Church today must do the same:

- **Stop fearing the "end times" as if they are a future apocalypse.**
- **Stop waiting for Jesus to take over when He already reigns.**
- **Stop expecting darkness to increase when the Light is already covering the earth.**

> _"Of the increase of His government and peace, there will be no end."_ (Isaiah 9:7)

The future of the world is not **doom—it is the ongoing restoration of all things in Christ.**

We are not waiting for a Kingdom **to come down**.  
The Kingdom is **already here, spreading, transforming, filling the earth.**

---

#### **Glorious Future: The Fullness of the Kingdom**

One day, the Kingdom that **began as a mustard seed** will **cover the entire earth**.

Habakkuk saw it:

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

Paul saw it:

> _"Then the end will come, when He hands over the Kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power."_ (1 Corinthians 15:24)

John saw it:

> _"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth… The dwelling place of God is now among the people, and He will dwell with them."_ (Revelation 21:1-3)

This is not **the destruction of creation**—it is **the renewal of all things.**

The story of the Gospel does not end in **collapse**.  
It ends in **restoration, renewal, and Christ reigning forever.**

The early Church transitioned from **waiting for a future hope** to **walking in a present reality**.

And today, we are called to do the same.

> _"The Kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)

The signs of the end were **fulfilled**.  
The Kingdom is **unfolding**.  
And the future is **glorious.**
