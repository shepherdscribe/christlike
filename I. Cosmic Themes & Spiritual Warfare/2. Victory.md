**The Ancient Serpent’s Defeat** – Christ’s victory over Satan through the cross
_(From the Fear of Darkness to the Certainty of Christ’s Victory)_

#### **Introduction: The Lie That Lingered**

Since the dawn of time, **one lie has echoed through history**. A whisper in the garden, a deception in the wilderness, a taunt at the cross—**“You will not surely die.”**

From Eden to Calvary, **Satan’s power was not in his strength but in his deception**. His dominion over mankind was built on a single foundation: **convincing humanity that God was not truly good, that His Word could not be trusted, and that rebellion would not bring death.**

And for generations, it seemed like the serpent had won.

- He had stolen dominion from Adam.
- He had enslaved nations in idolatry.
- He had twisted the hearts of kings, priests, and prophets.
- He had even dared to tempt the Son of God Himself.

But he underestimated something.

**He did not see the cross coming.**

#### **Core Scripture: Genesis 3:15**

_"I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The War Was Over Before It Began**

The first prophecy in the Bible was **not about judgment**—it was about **redemption**.

Before Adam and Eve were exiled from Eden, before Cain shed Abel’s blood, before nations rose and fell—**God had already declared Satan’s defeat.**

But for thousands of years, the serpent continued to rule.

- He corrupted the world so thoroughly that only Noah’s family survived the flood.
- He manipulated the nations to worship false gods and offer their children as sacrifices.
- He convinced Israel to chase after idols and trust in kings rather than Yahweh.
- He thought he had won when he turned the Pharisees against their own Messiah.

But in all his schemes, **Satan failed to understand one thing**—his dominion was only temporary.

The seed of the woman **was coming**.

And when Jesus arrived, **the kingdom of darkness began to shake.**

> _"The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work."_ (1 John 3:8)

This was not a **war between equals**. Satan was never an opponent who could overthrow God. **He was a rebellious created being, already sentenced to destruction.**

The serpent’s power was only ever in **the lie**.  
The moment Christ appeared, **truth invaded the world.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: Satan’s Defeat is Complete**

Many believers still live **as if the war is undecided**—as though Satan is still a rival to Christ, as though his power is still unchecked.

But the **New Covenant shifts everything**.

Jesus did not just **weaken** the enemy.  
He did not just **wound** him.  
He **crushed his head**.

> _"And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."_ (Colossians 2:15)

This means:  
✅ **Satan no longer has authority—only deception.**  
✅ **Hell was not created for people—it was created for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41).** 
✅ **Jesus didn’t just defeat the enemy—He stripped him of all legal right to rule.**

The cross was not just a moment of suffering. It was **an execution order for the dominion of darkness**.

> _"Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out."_ (John 12:31)

The serpent is not **reigning**—he is **writhing in his death throes**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Fear to Authority**

For generations, people have **feared the devil**. They have built doctrines that glorify his power, traditions that magnify his influence. They have treated him as an equal adversary to God, rather than as a **defeated enemy whose time is running out**.

The early Church had to unlearn this fear. They were transitioning from **a world where Satan ruled unchecked** to **a Kingdom where Jesus was enthroned**.

And Jesus did not leave them powerless.

> _"I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you."_ (Luke 10:19)

This is the shift from **Old Covenant fear to New Covenant dominion**:

- **In the Old Covenant, Satan had dominion. In the New Covenant, Christ reigns.**
- **In the Old Covenant, people needed prophets, priests, and rituals to stand against darkness. In the New Covenant, every believer carries the Spirit of God.**
- **In the Old Covenant, demons tormented unchecked. In the New Covenant, they flee at the name of Jesus.**

And yet, some still live in **fear of curses, strongholds, and demonic attacks**, as if the cross was not enough.

But Paul did not say, **“Fight to defeat Satan.”**  
He said, **“Stand firm.”**

> _"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."_ (James 4:7)

The war is won. **Now we enforce the victory.**

#### **Glorious Future: A World Without the Serpent**

There is coming a day when the victory of Christ will be **fully realized**.

Revelation declares what happens to the **ancient serpent**:

> _"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."_ (Revelation 20:10)

This is **not a battle scene**—this is a **sentencing**.

The serpent who once **whispered in the garden** will be **silenced forever**.  
The deceiver who once **held the world in darkness** will be **thrown into eternal judgment**.

And as for us?

> _"The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you."_ (Romans 16:20)

The enemy is **not our future problem**.  
He is **our past problem, already sentenced and awaiting final destruction**.

And we? We are **not a people waiting to be rescued from Satan**—we are **a people reigning with Christ over a defeated enemy**.

The story of the Bible does not end in fear.  
It ends in **victory, restoration, and the reign of Christ over all things**.

And the serpent’s voice?  
It will never be heard again.
