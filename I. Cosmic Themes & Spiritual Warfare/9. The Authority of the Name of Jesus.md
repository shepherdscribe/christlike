_(Transitioning from Religious Invocation to Kingdom Dominion & Sonship)_

#### **Introduction: More Than Just a Phrase**

For many believers, praying **“in Jesus’ name”** has become nothing more than a **religious formula**—a phrase tacked onto the end of prayers without truly understanding its power.

- **"Lord, heal them… in Jesus’ name."**
- **"Bless this food… in Jesus’ name."**
- **"Help me with this problem… in Jesus’ name."**

But the **name of Jesus is not a magic word.**

It is not a ritual.  
It is not an ending to a prayer.  
It is **the highest authority in heaven and on earth.**

The early Church did not just **say His name**—they **walked in His name**.

> _"Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son."_ (John 14:13)

The name of Jesus is **not just spoken—it is carried**.

#### **Core Scripture: Philippians 2:9-11**

_"Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Name Represents the Person**

In biblical culture, a **name was not just a label**—it was a representation of a person’s **nature, authority, and identity**.

When Jesus gave His disciples the right to use His name, He was giving them **the authority of His person and position**.

> _"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore, go in My name..."_ (Matthew 28:18-19)

This means:  
✅ **Using His name is not just speaking words—it is exercising His authority.**  
✅ **We do not invoke His name as outsiders—we carry it as sons.**  
✅ **His name is not just a defense against darkness—it is a declaration of dominion.**

When the apostles healed the sick, cast out demons, and performed miracles, they did not **beg God to move**—they **commanded things to shift in the authority of Jesus’ name.**

> _"In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!"_ (Acts 3:6)

This was **not just prayer**—this was **a governmental decree.**

They understood that **the name of Jesus is not just about asking—it is about enforcing the already-established rule of Christ.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Name is Our Legal Right to Operate in Christ’s Authority**

Under the Old Covenant, people had **no direct access** to God’s power. They depended on **priests, sacrifices, and mediators** to interact with God on their behalf.

But under the New Covenant, Jesus gave His authority **to His Church**.

> _"These signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and if they drink anything deadly, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."_ (Mark 16:17-18)

This means:  
✅ **We do not ask for permission to use His name—we have been given legal right to use it.**  
✅ **We do not beg for power—we already carry it.**  
✅ **We do not wait for authority—it has already been given.**

The **early Church functioned in this reality**, understanding that **Christ’s name was not just something to say—it was something to stand in.**

This is why:  
🔥 **Peter commanded the lame man to walk—not by his own power, but in the name of Jesus.**  
🔥 **Paul cast out demons—not by prayer alone, but by using the authority of Jesus’ name.**  
🔥 **The seventy disciples healed the sick and declared the Kingdom—not as religious servants, but as ambassadors walking in the authority of Christ.**

> _"Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name!"_ (Luke 10:17)

They did not just **say** the name—they **walked in it, lived in it, and carried it as their own.**

And today, the Church is called to do the same.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Religious Invocation to Kingdom Enforcement**

Many believers still live **as if the name of Jesus is a phrase they use rather than an identity they carry**.

They say:  
❌ **"I hope this prayer works… in Jesus’ name."**  
❌ **"I hope the enemy leaves me alone… in Jesus’ name."**  
❌ **"I hope healing happens… in Jesus’ name."**

But the early Church did not **hope**—they **declared and enforced** Christ’s authority.

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From praying weak prayers to commanding in Kingdom authority.**  
✅ **From seeing Jesus’ name as a request to seeing it as a decree.**  
✅ **From begging for breakthrough to enforcing what is already won.**

Paul did not say, **“I hope the enemy listens.”**  
He said:

> _"In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!"_ (Acts 16:18)

The Church was never meant to **live in fear, waiting for heaven**.  
The Church was meant to **walk in dominion, advancing the Kingdom.**

The name of Jesus is not just about **prayer—it is about governance.**

And the world will see **a victorious Church when believers stop invoking the name like outsiders and start carrying it as sons.**

> _"Whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus."_ (Colossians 3:17)

---

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Rules in His Name**

There will come a day when **every knee bows and every tongue confesses** the name of Jesus—not just because He is God, but because His **Kingdom has fully filled the earth.**

Daniel saw it:

> _"The God of heaven will set up a Kingdom that will never be destroyed... It will crush all other kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever."_ (Daniel 2:44)

John saw it:

> _"They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with Him will be His called, chosen, and faithful followers."_ (Revelation 17:14)

Paul saw it:

> _"At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth."_ (Philippians 2:10)

The Church will not end **as a passive religious group**—it will end **as the fully matured, fully ruling Body of Christ, governing in His name.**

The name of Jesus is **not just the identity of one Man—it is the inheritance of His people.**

And in the fullness of time, the Church will not be **running from darkness**—it will be **shining in full Kingdom dominion, enforcing the reign of Christ over all things.**

> _"The kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 11:15)
