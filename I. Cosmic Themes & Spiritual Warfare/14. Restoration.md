**The Restoration of All Things** – The new creation isn’t just future—it’s **already happening in Christ**

_(Transitioning from Destruction Theology to Renewal Theology)_

#### **Introduction: The Fear of a Fading World**

For generations, believers have spoken of the **end of the world** with a sense of dread. Wars, disasters, corruption—surely, the world is beyond saving. From the prophets of old to modern pulpits, a warning has echoed: **The world will burn. Judgment is coming. The end is near.**

And yet, **in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth... and He called it good.**

This is the tension: if God declared creation **good**, why would He be determined to destroy it? If Jesus came to **restore all things**, why would His mission end in obliteration?

Could it be that **we have misunderstood the end from the beginning?**

#### **Core Scripture: Acts 3:21**

_"Heaven must receive Him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as He promised long ago through His holy prophets."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Restoration, Not Annihilation**

In the Old Testament, prophets spoke of **judgment**—nations falling, empires collapsing, fire consuming. Israel, after breaking covenant with Yahweh, was often warned of **destruction**. When Babylon laid waste to Jerusalem, when the temple was torn down, when Israel was exiled, it seemed as though **God had abandoned the world to ruin**.

But something was unfolding. The prophets didn’t just speak of judgment—they spoke of **restoration**. They saw visions of a **new heavens and a new earth**. They prophesied of **a King who would reign forever, of deserts blossoming, of nations coming to Zion for healing**.

Jesus came, and He didn’t come **to destroy**—He came **to fulfill**. His mission was never to **end the world** but to **reconcile it to God**.

> _"For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."_ (John 3:17)

The problem is **not the world itself**. The problem is **sin, corruption, and decay**—things Jesus came to undo. **Jesus is not returning to burn creation to ashes—He is returning to complete the work of restoration.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Earth Will Be Filled with His Glory**

Under the Old Covenant, the world was divided: clean and unclean, holy and profane. The temple was the only place where God’s presence dwelled. But through Jesus, **heaven is invading earth**. The veil was torn. The Spirit was poured out. The mission of Christ’s followers is not to **escape earth** but to **transform it with His glory**.

Isaiah saw it:

> _"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

Paul saw it:

> _"The creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed... that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God."_ (Romans 8:19-21)

Revelation shows it:

> _"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away... And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.’"_ (Revelation 21:1-4)

Jesus is **not returning to destroy the world—He is returning to restore it**. The fire of God does not exist to **annihilate creation** but to **purify it**. The "new heavens and new earth" are not replacements for the old but **the renewal of all things under Christ's reign**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Escape to Redemption**

For too long, the Church has preached **escape** instead of **redemption**. We have taught believers to long for **heaven while neglecting earth**, to wait for a **rapture instead of preparing for restoration**.

But the early Church didn’t see it this way. The apostles didn’t sit back and wait for the world to end—they **transformed cities, healed the sick, raised the dead, and expanded the Kingdom**. They understood that their mission wasn’t to **endure earth until heaven came**—it was to **bring heaven to earth.**

The resurrection of Jesus was the **firstfruits** of this restoration. His risen body was **physical, tangible, real**—not an escape from matter but **a redemption of it**. The same way Christ was resurrected, **creation itself will be resurrected**.

> _"Behold, I am making all things new!"_ (Revelation 21:5)

This means:  
✅ **The Kingdom is expanding now, not waiting for a sudden takeover**  
✅ **Heaven and earth will unite, not be permanently separated**  
✅ **Christ is restoring creation, not erasing it**

#### **Glorious Future: A Restored World, A Renewed Humanity**

The future is **not destruction—it is renewal**. The early Church was transitioning from a **law-based view of judgment** to a **Christ-centered view of redemption**. Today, we stand in the **better understanding** of God’s plan:

- **The earth will be filled with His glory.**
- **The nations will come to the light of Christ.**
- **Creation itself will be made whole.**
- **Sin and death will be removed forever.**

We are not waiting for **an escape**—we are preparing for **a glorious restoration**.

We are not praying for **an end**—we are ushering in **the fullness of the Kingdom**.

Jesus is coming, not to wipe out the world, but to **set all things right**.

And even now, **the restoration has already begun.**
