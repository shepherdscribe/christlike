_(Transitioning from Cosmic Conflict to Christ’s Victory & Dominion)_

#### **Introduction: The War Before Bethlehem**

The Christmas story is often told in quiet scenes—**a manger, a star, shepherds in awe**. But behind the peaceful imagery of Bethlehem was a **cosmic war** that had raged since the dawn of time.

Long before angels sang over fields, before wise men followed a star, before Mary carried the Savior in her womb—**a battle was already underway.**

A prophecy had been spoken in Eden:

> _"I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."_ (Genesis 3:15)

The war began when **Lucifer fell**, continued when **Adam fell**, and reached its most decisive moment when **Jesus was born**.

**The birth of Christ was not just the arrival of a baby—it was an invasion.**

#### **Core Scripture: Revelation 12:1-5**

_"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon… The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born… She gave birth to a son, a male child, who ‘will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.’ And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus’ Birth Was an Act of War**

This is a **different** nativity story.

The woman in John’s vision represents **both Mary and Israel**—the people through whom the Messiah would come. The dragon, **Satan**, was ready to devour Him the moment He arrived.

And that’s exactly what happened.

- **Herod, inspired by darkness, sought to kill every baby boy in Bethlehem.**
- **The religious leaders, blinded by their own legalism, resisted the very One they had been waiting for.**
- **Demonic forces stirred up storms, possessed men, and attempted to stop Jesus before He could reach the cross.**

From the beginning, the enemy **knew who He was.**

And yet, no matter how much he fought, **he could not stop the inevitable.**

Jesus **was not just born**—He **was sent**. His arrival marked the **beginning of the end** for the kingdom of darkness.

The war had turned in heaven long before the birth of Christ, but now, for the first time, **God Himself had stepped onto the battlefield.**

And He did it **not as a warrior with a sword, but as a baby in a manger.**

Because **victory was never going to come through brute force. It would come through a cross.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Victory Has Already Been Won**

For centuries, humanity had been caught between **heaven and hell**, between the curse of sin and the promise of salvation. But the moment Christ came, **everything changed**.

> _"The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work."_ (1 John 3:8)

Under the Old Covenant, the battle was **external**—nations fighting nations, sacrifices for sins, spiritual battles fought through obedience to the law.

But under the New Covenant, the battle is **internal and spiritual**—and more importantly, **it is already won**.

Jesus did not come to **continue the war**—He came to **finish it**.

> _"It is finished."_ (John 19:30)

This means:  
✅ **Satan is defeated, not just weakened.**  
✅ **The war is over, but the resistance continues.**  
✅ **Our fight is not to win, but to enforce the victory already secured.**

We do not battle **as warriors trying to claim a victory**—we battle **as sons and daughters who already stand in it**.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Battling for Victory to Standing in Victory**

Many believers still live as though the war **is undecided**. They pray from a place of **fear, rather than authority**. They fight as though Satan still has power to overthrow Christ’s reign.

But the early Church was learning a new truth:

> _"And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."_ (Colossians 2:15)

**The cross was the battlefield, and Jesus didn’t just win—He publicly humiliated the enemy.**

The **only power Satan has now** is deception—the ability to **convince believers that they are still fighting for what they already have**.

Paul didn’t say, **"Fight until you win."**  
He said, **"Stand firm."**

> _"Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes."_ (Ephesians 6:11)

This is the transition the Church must make:

- **From striving to reigning.**
- **From fear to authority.**
- **From defensive prayers to offensive declarations.**

**The Messiah has already crushed the serpent’s head. We do not fight for victory. We fight from it.**

#### **Glorious Future: The Kingdom Has Already Begun**

The **real victory** was not in Bethlehem.  
It was not even in Calvary.  
The real victory was when Christ **rose and ascended to the throne.**

> _"She gave birth to a son, a male child, who ‘will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.’ And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne."_ (Revelation 12:5)

This is why Revelation 12 does not show a prolonged war in heaven—it shows a **decisive victory**.

The Kingdom of God **is not something we are waiting for**—it has already begun. Jesus is already reigning. He is not **coming to establish His Kingdom**—He is returning to **consummate it**.

This means:

- **Satan is not winning, no matter what the world looks like.**
- **The Church is not losing—it is advancing.**
- **We are not waiting for victory—we are living in it.**

This is the **fullness of the Gospel**: The war was won, the King has ascended, and His Kingdom **is already expanding across the earth.**

And the gates of hell **will not prevail against it.**
