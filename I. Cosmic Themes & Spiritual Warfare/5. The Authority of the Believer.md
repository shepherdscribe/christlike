**The Authority of the Believer** – Walking in dominion through Christ
_(Transitioning from Old Covenant Priesthood to New Covenant Sonship & Dominion)_

#### **Introduction: The Forgotten Authority**

For generations, believers have lived **beneath their inheritance**, crying out to God for power they already possess, begging for victory that has already been won.

They plead for protection from the enemy, unaware that **they have been given dominion over him**.  
They wait for permission to walk in authority, unaware that **Christ already commissioned them**.  
They pray as if they are powerless, forgetting that **Jesus said, “All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me” (Matthew 28:18)—and then He handed it to them.**

The early Church had to make a profound transition: **from servants under the Old Covenant to sons and daughters reigning with Christ.**

The question is: **Have we made that transition?**

#### **Core Scripture: Luke 10:19**

_"I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you."_

#### **The Christ Filter: The Authority We Lost, The Authority He Restored**

In the beginning, God gave **dominion to mankind**:

> _"Let us make mankind in Our image, in Our likeness, so that they may rule over… all the creatures that move along the ground."_ (Genesis 1:26)

Humanity was created to **rule in partnership with God**. Adam was given **authority over the earth**, but through sin, he surrendered that authority to **the enemy**.

- **Where Adam failed, Christ succeeded.**
- **Where Adam surrendered, Christ reclaimed.**
- **Where Adam lost dominion, Christ restored it.**

Jesus did not come **only to forgive sins**—He came to **restore the Kingdom**.

> _"For this reason the Son of God appeared, that He might destroy the works of the devil."_ (1 John 3:8)

And the moment Christ rose from the grave, the **dominion of Adam was restored to the New Adam—Jesus.**

This is why, after His resurrection, Jesus did not say, **“I will soon have authority.”**  
He said:

> _"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore, go..."_ (Matthew 28:18-19)

The authority Adam lost, Christ reclaimed. And Christ **handed it back to His people.**

This means:  
✅ **Satan no longer holds dominion—only deception.**  
✅ **The Church is not a group of spiritual refugees—it is an advancing Kingdom.**  
✅ **Authority is not given to a select few—it is given to all who are in Christ.**

The Church is not waiting for a future moment to receive authority.

**It was given the moment Christ ascended.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Authority of Sons, Not Servants**

Under the Old Covenant, **only priests, prophets, and kings carried divine authority**. The people had to approach **God through a mediator**—whether a high priest, a judge, or a prophet.

But in the New Covenant, **Jesus has removed all barriers**.

> _"To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve His God and Father—to Him be glory and power forever and ever!"_ (Revelation 1:5-6)

This is the radical transition:

- **In the Old Covenant, only the anointed carried authority. In the New Covenant, all believers carry it.**
- **In the Old Covenant, the Holy Spirit came upon a few. In the New Covenant, the Holy Spirit lives within all.**
- **In the Old Covenant, dominion was lost. In the New Covenant, dominion is restored.**

The Spirit that **parted the Red Sea, raised the dead, and defeated kingdoms** is now **inside every believer**.

Jesus did not come to create **a Church dependent on prophets and priests**—He came to create **sons and daughters who walk in the same power He carried**.

> _"The one who believes in Me will also do the works that I do. And he will do even greater works than these, because I am going to the Father."_ (John 14:12)

The early Church had to **unlearn the Old Covenant mentality**—they were no longer powerless servants. They were **Spirit-empowered ambassadors of the King**.

So are we.

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Powerlessness to Dominion**

Many in the Church still live as if they are **beggars, not heirs**. They still approach God **as if they are distant**, still fear the enemy **as if he has power**, still wait for revival **as if they were not the carriers of it**.

But Paul’s revelation was clear:

> _"God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms."_ (Ephesians 2:6)

Believers are not waiting to **one day be enthroned**—they are **already seated in Christ’s authority**.

This means:

- **We do not pray for victory—we declare it.**
- **We do not ask for power—we walk in it.**
- **We do not fight for dominion—we enforce it.**

This is why Jesus did not say, **“Wait, and I will cast out demons.”**  
He said:

> _"In My name they will drive out demons."_ (Mark 16:17)

Authority is **not found in striving**.  
Authority is **not reserved for spiritual elites**.  
Authority is **already given to those who believe**.

This is the New Covenant reality:  
**Jesus reigns, and we reign with Him.**

#### **Glorious Future: A People Who Walk in Christ’s Fullness**

The Church is not waiting for a **future moment to walk in power**—it is called to walk in power **now**.

The prophets saw a day when **the people of God would be filled with His Spirit**—not just one man, not just one generation, but an entire people **moving in divine authority.**

Joel saw it:

> _"I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and daughters will prophesy."_ (Joel 2:28)

Paul saw it:

> _"The creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."_ (Romans 8:19)

John saw it:

> _"To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with My Father on His throne."_ (Revelation 3:21)

The end of the story is **not a weak Church begging for deliverance**—it is a **radiant Bride walking in the fullness of Christ’s dominion**.

This means:

- **Satan’s kingdom is already collapsing.**
- **The Church is already reigning with Christ.**
- **The glory of God is already filling the earth.**

What remains is for **the sons and daughters of God to awaken to who they really are.**

And when they do, the earth will never be the same.
