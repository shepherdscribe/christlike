**The Shepherd & the Sheep** – Jesus leads by **love, not by fear**
_(Transitioning from Leadership by Fear to Leadership by Love)_

#### **Introduction: Jesus, the True Shepherd**

Throughout Scripture, God reveals Himself as a **Shepherd** who lovingly leads His people:

- _"The Lord is my Shepherd, I lack nothing."_ (Psalm 23:1)
- _"He tends His flock like a Shepherd; He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries them close to His heart."_ (Isaiah 40:11)
- _"I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep."_ (John 10:11)

🔥 **Jesus did not come to establish a religious system—He came to lead His people as a Shepherd.**

But many leaders throughout history have **misrepresented God's heart**:  
❌ **They led by control instead of care.**  
❌ **They ruled with fear instead of love.**  
❌ **They built religious hierarchies instead of feeding the flock.**

Jesus came to **restore true shepherding**:  
✅ **He does not drive His sheep—He calls them by name.**  
✅ **He does not burden them—He carries them on His shoulders.**  
✅ **He does not scatter them—He lays down His life for them.**

> _"My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me."_ (John 10:27)

🔥 **The Church must transition from leadership by fear to leadership by love.**

#### **Core Scripture: Ezekiel 34:15-16**

_"I Myself will tend My sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign Lord. I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Is the Model of True Leadership**

Before Christ, leadership was often **about power and control**:

- Kings **ruled with force** and sought to expand their kingdoms.
- Priests **held exclusive access** to God’s presence.
- Religious leaders **burdened the people** with laws and rituals.

But when Jesus came, He demonstrated a **completely different model of leadership**:  
🔥 **He did not sit on a throne—He walked among the people.**  
🔥 **He did not seek to be served—He served others.**  
🔥 **He did not demand loyalty—He invited people into relationship.**

> _"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many."_ (Matthew 20:28)

🔥 **Jesus’ leadership is not based on control—it is based on self-giving love.**

This means:  
✅ **A true leader lays down their life for others.**  
✅ **A true shepherd cares more about the sheep than about status.**  
✅ **A true pastor feeds the flock instead of feeding on the flock.**

> _"Woe to the shepherds who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?"_ (Ezekiel 34:2)

🔥 **Jesus is not looking for CEOs—He is looking for shepherds!**

The Church must transition **from power-driven leadership to Christ-centered shepherding.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: The Shepherd Now Lives in Us**

Under the Old Covenant:

- People **relied on priests** to mediate between them and God.
- The High Priest **alone could enter the Holy of Holies** once a year.
- Leadership was **a hierarchy**, with power concentrated at the top.

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus is our High Priest, and we have direct access to God.**  
✅ **Every believer is part of a royal priesthood.**  
✅ **Leadership is not about status—it is about servanthood.**

> _"You were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."_ (1 Peter 2:25)

🔥 **Jesus is not just the Shepherd over us—He is the Shepherd within us.**

This means:  
✅ **We do not need spiritual gatekeepers—Jesus Himself leads us.**  
✅ **We are not left to wander—He guides us every step of the way.**  
✅ **We do not need to strive—He provides for us abundantly.**

> _"I am the Good Shepherd. I know My sheep, and My sheep know Me."_ (John 10:14)

🔥 **The Church must transition from religious hierarchy to Spirit-led intimacy with Christ.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Ruling Over People to Walking Beside Them**

Many church leaders still operate in **an Old Covenant mindset**:  
❌ **They see themselves as spiritual gatekeepers instead of guides.**  
❌ **They create dependence on human leadership instead of pointing people to Jesus.**  
❌ **They demand submission instead of modeling servanthood.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **True leadership is not about control—it is about care.**  
🔥 **True authority is not about position—it is about servanthood.**  
🔥 **True shepherding does not demand—it nurtures.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock."_ (1 Peter 5:2-3)

🔥 **Shepherds lead by example, not by force.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From controlling people to guiding them in love.**  
✅ **From demanding submission to earning trust.**  
✅ **From building personal kingdoms to serving the Kingdom of God.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in the Shepherd’s Love**

The final destiny of the Church is **not an institution ruled by men—it is a flock led by the Good Shepherd.**

David saw it:

> _"The Lord is my Shepherd; I lack nothing."_ (Psalm 23:1)

Ezekiel prophesied it:

> _"I Myself will search for My sheep and look after them."_ (Ezekiel 34:11)

Jesus promised it:

> _"I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of My hand."_ (John 10:28)

🔥 **The Church will not end in confusion—it will be securely led by the Shepherd.**  
🔥 **We will not be scattered—we will be gathered into His presence.**  
🔥 **The final revelation of the Church is not as an organization—it is as a beloved flock, following the Lamb wherever He goes.**

The world will not end **with people striving to find their way**—  
🔥 **It will end with a Shepherd leading His people into eternal pastures.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not wandering—  
🔥 **She is being led by the voice of her Shepherd!**
