**Faith That Moves Mountains** – Faith isn’t about formulas—it’s about **knowing Him**
_(Transitioning from Formulaic Faith to a Relationship of Trust in God)_

#### **Introduction: The True Power of Faith**

Many believers misunderstand **what faith truly is**.  
❌ **Some see faith as a formula for getting what they want.**  
❌ **Others see faith as a measurement of how much they believe.**  
❌ **Some struggle because they think they don’t have “enough” faith.**

But Scripture presents **a different vision of faith**:  
🔥 **Faith is not a formula—it is trust in a faithful God.**  
🔥 **Faith is not about how much we believe—it is about who we believe in.**  
🔥 **Faith is not about forcing God’s hand—it is about walking in alignment with His heart.**

> _"Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."_ (Matthew 17:20)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a transactional faith to a trusting relationship with God.**

#### **Core Scripture: Hebrews 11:1**

_"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Faith Is Not a Formula—It Is Trust in a Person**

Before Christ, faith was often seen as:  
🔥 **Obeying the Law to receive God’s blessings.**  
🔥 **Trusting in rituals and sacrifices for divine favor.**  
🔥 **Measuring one’s righteousness by outward works.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined faith**:  
🔥 **Faith is not about striving—it is about surrender.**  
🔥 **Faith is not about formulas—it is about following Jesus.**  
🔥 **Faith is not about getting what we want—it is about trusting that God’s plan is good.**

> _"Have faith in God," Jesus answered. "Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them."_ (Mark 11:22-23)

🔥 **Faith is not just about moving mountains—it is about knowing the One who holds the mountains.**

This means:  
✅ **Faith is not a tool to control outcomes—it is trust in God’s perfect will.**  
✅ **Faith is not about removing all difficulties—it is about knowing God is with us through them.**  
✅ **Faith is not about size—it is about the Source.**

> _"Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith."_ (Hebrews 12:2)

🔥 **The Church must transition from seeing faith as a tool to seeing faith as a relationship with God.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: Faith Is Resting in God’s Promises**

Under the Old Covenant:

- Faith was often linked to **works and rituals.**
- Blessings and curses were tied to **obedience to the Law.**
- Faith was often **transactional—if you obey, you are blessed; if you fail, you are cursed.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Faith is not about following rules—it is about following Christ.**  
✅ **Faith is not a transaction—it is a relationship.**  
✅ **Faith is about resting in what Jesus has already accomplished.**

Paul declared:

> _"For we walk by faith, not by sight."_ (2 Corinthians 5:7)

🔥 **Faith is not about controlling the future—it is about trusting God in the present.**

This means:  
✅ **We do not try to “earn” God’s blessings—we receive them by grace.**  
✅ **We do not measure faith by visible results—we trust God’s unseen work.**  
✅ **We do not fear uncertainty—we trust that God is already there.**

> _"Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God."_ (Romans 4:20)

🔥 **The Church must transition from striving for faith to resting in the faithfulness of God.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Fear-Based Faith to Confident Trust**

Many believers still live with **a performance-based view of faith**:  
❌ **They believe that if they don’t have "enough" faith, God won’t move.**  
❌ **They think unanswered prayers mean they lacked faith.**  
❌ **They struggle with doubt and feel guilty for not always being “strong” in faith.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Faith is not about certainty—it is about trust.**  
🔥 **Faith is not about controlling God—it is about surrendering to Him.**  
🔥 **Faith is not about avoiding difficulties—it is about walking with Jesus through them.**

Paul wrote:

> _"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed."_ (2 Corinthians 4:8-9)

🔥 **True faith is not about removing trials—it is about remaining steadfast in them.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From seeing faith as a magic formula to seeing it as a deep trust in God.**  
✅ **From fearing doubt to bringing our questions to Jesus.**  
✅ **From measuring faith by results to measuring it by trust in God’s character.**

> _"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."_ (Job 13:15)

🔥 **The power of faith is not in how much we believe—it is in who we believe.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Unshakable Faith**

The final destiny of the Church is **not living in fear of weak faith—it is standing strong in Christ.**

Abraham saw it:

> _"Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed."_ (Romans 4:18)

Jesus spoke of it:

> _"When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"_ (Luke 18:8)

Paul declared it:

> _"Now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."_ (1 Corinthians 13:13)

🔥 **We are not just growing in faith—we are being built into an unshakable Kingdom!**  
🔥 **We are not waiting for perfect conditions—we are trusting the One who holds the future!**  
🔥 **We are not striving for faith—we are walking in the faithfulness of Christ!**

The world will not end with **believers struggling to have "enough" faith**—  
🔥 **It will end with a victorious Bride standing in confident trust in her King!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not wavering—  
🔥 **She is standing in faith, waiting for the return of the King!**
