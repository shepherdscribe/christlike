**Wisdom’s Cry in the Streets** – True wisdom reflects **Jesus’ heart, not religious pride**
_(Transitioning from Religious Pride to the Humility of True Wisdom)_

#### **Introduction: The Call of Wisdom**

Throughout Scripture, **wisdom is personified as a voice calling out to all who will listen**:

- _"Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares."_ (Proverbs 1:20)
- _"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."_ (Proverbs 9:10)
- _"Christ has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness, and redemption."_ (1 Corinthians 1:30)

🔥 **True wisdom is not about knowledge—it is about knowing Christ.**

But many believers still operate with **the world’s version of wisdom**:  
❌ **They seek intellectual superiority rather than spiritual transformation.**  
❌ **They rely on religious traditions rather than divine revelation.**  
❌ **They measure wisdom by complexity rather than by Christlikeness.**

Yet, when God speaks of wisdom:  
✅ **It is not reserved for the elite—it calls out in the streets to all who will listen.**  
✅ **It is not found in pride—it is found in humility.**  
✅ **It is not about gaining knowledge—it is about walking in divine understanding.**

> _"Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance."_ (Proverbs 1:5)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a wisdom of pride to a wisdom that reflects the heart of Christ.**

#### **Core Scripture: James 3:17**

_"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere."_

#### **The Christ Filter: Wisdom Is Not Intellectualism—It Is Knowing the Heart of God**

Before Christ, wisdom was often seen as:  
🔥 **The ability to debate and win arguments.**  
🔥 **Mastery of religious laws and traditions.**  
🔥 **A sign of status and influence.**

But Jesus **redefined wisdom**:  
🔥 **True wisdom is found in childlike faith.**  
🔥 **True wisdom is demonstrated through humility, not superiority.**  
🔥 **True wisdom is not in many words—it is in Christ Himself.**

> _"I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."_ (Luke 10:21)

🔥 **Jesus did not come to impress the scholars—He came to reveal the Father.**

This means:  
✅ **Wisdom is not about being clever—it is about walking in love.**  
✅ **Wisdom is not about proving points—it is about pointing to Christ.**  
✅ **Wisdom is not about control—it is about surrender to God.**

> _"The foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom."_ (1 Corinthians 1:25)

🔥 **The Church must transition from intellectual pride to the simplicity of walking in divine wisdom.**

#### **New Covenant Reality: We Have the Mind of Christ**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Wisdom was tied to the Law**—following commandments brought life.
- **Religious leaders controlled knowledge**—they dictated what people could learn.
- **Understanding God was limited**—the full revelation of Christ had not yet come.

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Jesus has been made wisdom for us (1 Corinthians 1:30).**  
✅ **We have direct access to divine revelation through the Holy Spirit (John 16:13).**  
✅ **We are given the "mind of Christ" to discern spiritual truths (1 Corinthians 2:16).**

Paul declared:

> _"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."_ (Romans 12:2)

🔥 **True wisdom is not just knowing facts—it is being transformed into the likeness of Christ.**

This means:  
✅ **We do not rely on human reasoning alone—we seek God’s perspective.**  
✅ **We do not chase after complex theology for its own sake—we pursue Christ.**  
✅ **We do not measure wisdom by intellect—we measure it by the fruit of the Spirit.**

> _"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."_ (Proverbs 9:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from seeking knowledge about God to walking in relationship with Him.**

#### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Religious Elitism to Walking in God’s Wisdom**

Many believers today still live with **a prideful approach to wisdom**:  
❌ **They define wisdom as knowledge rather than intimacy with Christ.**  
❌ **They use theological debates to elevate themselves rather than edify others.**  
❌ **They equate spiritual depth with intellectual complexity rather than Christlike humility.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Wisdom is not found in endless debate—it is found in surrender to Christ.**  
🔥 **Wisdom is not about religious titles—it is about a transformed heart.**  
🔥 **Wisdom is not about impressing others—it is about revealing Jesus.**

Paul wrote:

> _"For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified."_ (1 Corinthians 2:2)

🔥 **The Church must transition from self-focused knowledge to God-centered wisdom.**

The wisdom of the world **seeks dominance, self-promotion, and control**—  
🔥 **The wisdom of God is gentle, loving, and full of mercy.**

> _"Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."_ (1 Corinthians 8:1)

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From arrogance to humility.**  
✅ **From intellectualism to divine revelation.**  
✅ **From self-exaltation to the wisdom of the cross.**

> _"The wisdom that comes from heaven is pure, peace-loving, and full of mercy."_ (James 3:17)

🔥 **True wisdom looks like Jesus.**

#### **Glorious Future: A Church That Walks in Divine Wisdom**

The final destiny of the Church is **not being filled with knowledge—it is being filled with the wisdom and glory of Christ.**

Solomon saw it:

> _"Blessed are those who listen to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway. For those who find me find life."_ (Proverbs 8:34-35)

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."_ (Isaiah 11:9)

Paul declared it:

> _"The mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations is now disclosed to the Lord’s people: Christ in you, the hope of glory."_ (Colossians 1:26-27)

🔥 **We are not just gaining wisdom—we are becoming the wisdom of God revealed in Christ!**  
🔥 **We are not just students of theology—we are carriers of divine revelation.**  
🔥 **We are not just seekers of knowledge—we are vessels of Christ’s glory.**

The world will not end **with people exalting human wisdom**—  
🔥 **It will end with every knee bowing before the wisdom of the Lamb.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not debating—  
🔥 **She is walking in the radiant wisdom of God!**
