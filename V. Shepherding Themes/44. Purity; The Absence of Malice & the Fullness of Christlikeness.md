### **Purity: The Absence of Malice & the Fullness of Christlikeness**

_(Transitioning from Legalistic Purity to a Heart Free from Malice, Deception, and Selfishness)_

---

### **Introduction: What Is True Purity?**

Many believers misunderstand **purity**, often reducing it to:  
❌ **External behavior—how one dresses, speaks, or acts in public.**  
❌ **Only sexual morality—ignoring deeper issues of the heart.**  
❌ **A performance-based mindset—thinking purity is about avoiding bad things rather than becoming like Christ.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **Purity is not just the absence of sin—it is the absence of malice, deception, and selfishness.**  
🔥 **True purity is not about outward appearance—it is about an undivided heart fully surrendered to Christ.**  
🔥 **Purity is not self-righteousness—it is living in the fullness of God’s love and integrity.**

> _"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."_ (Matthew 5:8)

🔥 **The Church must transition from external purity to an inner purity that flows from Christ.**

### **Core Scripture: 1 Peter 2:1-2**

_"Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation."_

🔥 **Purity is not just avoiding sin—it is removing every trace of malice, envy, and deceit.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Modeled a Heart Without Malice**

Before Christ, people saw purity in different ways:  
🔥 **The Pharisees defined purity by religious rules and outward performance.**  
🔥 **The Greeks sought purity through philosophy and self-discipline but lacked divine transformation.**  
🔥 **Society often saw purity as weakness, associating it with naivety or inexperience.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined purity**:  
🔥 **Purity is about a heart that is free from corruption, not just actions that appear holy.**  
🔥 **Purity is about sincerity, not religious showmanship.**  
🔥 **Purity is about love without selfish motives, not about self-righteousness.**

> _"The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks."_ (Luke 6:45)

🔥 **Jesus was pure because He was free from malice, deception, and selfish ambition.**

This means:  
✅ **A pure heart is not just morally clean—it is free from envy, hypocrisy, and manipulation.**  
✅ **Purity is not about being ‘better’ than others—it is about being more like Christ.**  
✅ **True purity leads to clarity, integrity, and a life that reflects God's nature.**

> _"For the wisdom that comes from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere."_ (James 3:17)

🔥 **The Church must transition from legalistic purity to purity that flows from a heart filled with Christ.**

### **New Covenant Reality: Purity Is a Transformation, Not a Performance**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Purity was based on rituals, washings, and outward observance of the Law.**
- **Impurity was often external—contact with the "unclean" made someone impure.**
- **Religious leaders focused on avoiding impurity but failed to address the heart.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Purity is internal first, flowing outward into behavior and relationships.**  
✅ **Jesus cleanses us from within, making us pure by His Spirit.**  
✅ **Purity is no longer about ritual but about transformation.**

Paul declared:

> _"To the pure, all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, because their minds and consciences are corrupted."_ (Titus 1:15)

🔥 **Purity is about how we see and interact with the world, not just about following rules.**

This means:  
✅ **A heart that is truly pure sees through the lens of love, not judgment.**  
✅ **Purity transforms our motives and relationships, not just our behaviors.**  
✅ **Our purity is not self-made—it is the result of Christ’s life within us.**

> _"And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure."_ (1 John 3:3)

🔥 **The Church must transition from striving for purity to living in the purity of Christ.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Legalism to Christlike Integrity**

Many believers still live with **a misguided view of purity**:  
❌ **Some think purity is about strict rules rather than a transformed heart.**  
❌ **Others view purity as weakness, failing to see its power in relationships.**  
❌ **Many seek purity for selfish gain (to look good, to gain favor) rather than to reflect Christ.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Purity is strength—it produces clarity, wisdom, and peace.**  
🔥 **A pure heart leads to trustworthiness, credibility, and favor before God and man.**  
🔥 **Purity creates unity in the Body of Christ by removing malice, selfish ambition, and deceit.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Let love be genuine. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves."_ (Romans 12:9-10)

🔥 **A pure heart produces sincere love, not hidden agendas.**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From performing purity to living in purity.**  
✅ **From focusing only on sexual purity to embracing purity in thought, speech, and motives.**  
✅ **From legalism to a purity that reflects the love and wisdom of Christ.**

> _"Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life."_ (Proverbs 4:23)

🔥 **True purity flows from a heart that is completely yielded to God.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Reflects Christ’s Pure Love**

The final destiny of the Church is **not to be obsessed with rules, but to be fully transformed into the image of Christ.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool."_ (Isaiah 1:18)

Jesus declared it:

> _"Now you are clean because of the word I have spoken to you."_ (John 15:3)

Paul revealed it:

> _"Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless."_ (Ephesians 5:25-27)

🔥 **The Church is not called to legalism—it is called to a pure, love-filled relationship with Christ.**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about avoiding the world—it is about shining with purity and truth in the midst of it.**  
🔥 **We are not called to be pure for purity’s sake—we are called to be pure so that we may see and reveal God.**

The world will not end **with a Church obsessed with rules**—  
🔥 **It will end with a pure Bride, filled with love, wisdom, and sincerity.**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not stained with malice—  
🔥 **She is pure, filled with the love and righteousness of her King!**
