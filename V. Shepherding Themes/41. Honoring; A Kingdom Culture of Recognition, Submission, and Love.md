Honoring: A Kingdom Culture of Recognition, Submission, and Love
_(Transitioning from Obligation-Based Honor to Spirit-Led Honor Rooted in Christ)_

---

### **Introduction: What Does It Mean to Honor?**

Honor is a foundational principle in the Kingdom of God, yet many believers misunderstand it.

Some see honor as:  
❌ **A rigid, forced obligation—rooted in control and fear.**  
❌ **A status-based practice—reserved only for authority figures or those we agree with.**  
❌ **A cultural tradition rather than a spiritual discipline.**

But **Scripture paints a different vision**:  
🔥 **Honor is not about exalting people—it is about recognizing God's work in them.**  
🔥 **True honor is not about hierarchy—it is about a heart posture of love.**  
🔥 **Honor is part of God’s very nature, modeled within the Trinity.**

> _"Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves."_ (Romans 12:10)

🔥 **The Church must transition from a forced culture of honor to a Spirit-led practice of Kingdom honor.**

### **Core Scripture: 1 Peter 2:17**

_"Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor."_

🔥 **Honor is not selective—it applies to all people, reflecting God’s love.**

### **The Christ Filter: Jesus Modeled Honor Through Humility**

Before Christ, people viewed honor in different ways:  
🔥 **In religious circles, honor was tied to status—Pharisees sought recognition.**  
🔥 **In politics, honor was enforced—kings and emperors demanded it.**  
🔥 **In society, honor was given based on wealth, reputation, and power.**

But when Jesus came, He **redefined honor**:  
🔥 **He honored the Father by submitting to His will (John 8:49).**  
🔥 **He honored people by serving them, even washing the feet of His disciples (John 13:12-15).**  
🔥 **He honored those considered least—sinners, women, children, outcasts (Luke 7:44-47).**

> _"Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve."_ (Matthew 20:26-28)

🔥 **Jesus demonstrated that honor is not about being above others—it is about lifting others up.**

This means:  
✅ **Honor is not about who is "higher"—it is about recognizing the value in every person.**  
✅ **We do not honor out of obligation—we honor out of love.**  
✅ **True honor is not forced—it flows from humility and gratitude.**

> _"Honor your father and mother—which is the first commandment with a promise—so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."_ (Ephesians 6:2-3)

🔥 **The Church must transition from an honor system based on position to one based on Christlike humility.**

### **New Covenant Reality: Honor Flows From Relationship, Not Obligation**

Under the Old Covenant:

- **Honor was often associated with law, duty, and strict observance.**
- **People honored God out of fear of punishment.**
- **Honor was tied to social and religious rankings.**

But under the New Covenant:  
✅ **Honor is based on love, not legalism.**  
✅ **We honor because we see God’s image in every person.**  
✅ **Honor is given freely, not demanded or manipulated.**

Paul declared:

> _"Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching."_ (1 Timothy 5:17)

🔥 **Honor is not just for those in leadership—it is for all believers as part of Kingdom culture.**

This means:  
✅ **Honor is not something we wait to receive—it is something we freely give.**  
✅ **We do not withhold honor based on personal preferences or biases.**  
✅ **True honor strengthens relationships and reflects God’s heart.**

> _"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves."_ (Philippians 2:3)

🔥 **The Church must transition from an honor culture based on duty to one rooted in Spirit-led love.**

### **The Church’s Own Transition: From Selective Honor to a Culture of Honor**

Many believers still live with **a misunderstanding of honor**:  
❌ **Some think honor is only for leaders, not for all people.**  
❌ **Others reject honor completely, mistaking it for flattery or manipulation.**  
❌ **Some honor only when it is convenient or beneficial.**

But the early Church understood:  
🔥 **Honor is foundational to the Kingdom.**  
🔥 **It is not about status—it is about recognizing the image of God in others.**  
🔥 **Honor creates unity, strengthens the Church, and glorifies God.**

Paul wrote:

> _"Outdo one another in showing honor."_ (Romans 12:10)

🔥 **Imagine a Church where believers strive to honor each other more and more!**

The Church must transition:  
✅ **From honoring only leaders to honoring all believers.**  
✅ **From withholding honor to making it a lifestyle.**  
✅ **From seeing honor as optional to embracing it as Kingdom culture.**

> _"Give to everyone what you owe them: If respect, then respect; if honor, then honor."_ (Romans 13:7)

🔥 **Honor is not about obligation—it is about obedience to Christ’s command to love.**

### **Glorious Future: A Church That Honors in a Christlike Way**

The final destiny of the Church is **not division, pride, or self-promotion—it is a culture of honor that reflects Christ.**

Isaiah prophesied it:

> _"I will make you a light for the nations, that My salvation may reach to the ends of the earth."_ (Isaiah 49:6)

Jesus declared it:

> _"If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him."_ (John 12:26)

Paul revealed it:

> _"So that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."_ (Philippians 2:10-11)

🔥 **The Church is not called to compete for honor—we are called to give honor freely!**  
🔥 **The Gospel is not about demanding honor—it is about modeling honor in love.**  
🔥 **We are not called to seek recognition—we are called to reflect Christ in all we do.**

The world will not end **with believers fighting for position**—  
🔥 **It will end with the Bride of Christ honoring the King in fullness of joy!**

> _"The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’"_ (Revelation 22:17)

The Bride is not seeking honor for herself—  
🔥 **She is honoring her King in perfect unity with Him!**
